They\u2019re looking for volunteers who share their stories / help tech workshops in high schools in SF.\nPlease DM me if you\u2019re interested in volunteering!\n<http://www.igniteworldwide.org/>\n\n*Upcoming volunteering opportunities*\n1. 10/24/18 (Wed) 11:45am - 1:20pm\nPlace: Galileo HS (1150 Francisco St San Francisco, CA 94109)\nGalileo High School\u2019s IGNITE chapter is looking for a diverse group of women with to share their personal story with a diverse group of girls.

The chapter is also looking for women working on the computer science and robotics side of life sciences to tell their story.\n\nSharing your stories and teaching are amazing opportunities for both of you and them - you will also learn new things and get inspiration from the experiences.

Here is an article that Leslie Kim (the alum who helped organize last week's women's kickoff dinner) shared this article, so I thought I would pass it along. <https://jvns.ca/blog/2018/09/01/learning-skills-you-can-practice/>Thanks Phyllis!! I voted for you!!!Hey ladies!! The ballot is out for class representatives. I am not going to campaign against anyone because there are a lot of great ladies on the ballot. Just want to remind everyone to vote and make our voices heard! Let\u2019s try to get some female representation because as we know, it\u2019s easy for females to advocate for everyone regardless of gender but sometimes males don\u2019t do the same for us. Female representation is a great way for us to make our collective voices heard to the administrators and other students! <!channel> hey, \nI was running some important errands and thought I\u2019d be back in time but I don\u2019t think I will, so I\u2019ll catch y\u2019all next time :sparkles:<!channel> For those of you joining us tonight for the Women's Dinner we will be meeting the classroom downstairs!

A few of you have. Appreciated! As many as possible and you can/should ask your hr/recruiting point of contact after your interview(s) for the list of names/emails of ppl you met with if they weren't provided. I tend to just fold it into my thank you note to them! \nAlso, don't be shy connecting with each of them post-interview on LI.Should we thank all the interviewers who have interviewed us? The reason I'm asking is that a lot of them didn't give out their emails.Hi ladies, \nI am disappointed to say that I've begun to get a steady stream of feedback from partners and allies that they are not experiencing the professional timeliness and good manners (quick thank you note after a call or your meeting) from PC students. This is universal and not specific to one person.\nPlease make this a high priority starting today.\nPlease take a few minutes and send brief thank you emails to all the speakers, mentors, informational interviews, tours, job interviews you have had since January, if you haven't already. \nRemember, it is never too late to say Thank You. If you need email addresses, please ping Jade or me.\nEveryone has their \"thing\". Good manners is mine b/c my network is my professional currency.\nIt's your professional reputation (and ours and sometimes mine or other students/staff) that gets dinged when we don't all show outsiders this common curtesy. \nPlease and thank you will build, maintain your network and be the difference one day in having doors open for you, favors extended and jobs offered. It's free, fast and easy. If you need help or templates let me know. I'm happy to help you.  \nI'm saying this to you as a group because you, as female engineers, are held in the public for better or worse to a higher standard with additional attention and interest in seeing you succeed.  I also am extra vested in YOUR success, as you know. Help me help you.  Please PM by EOD with an update on who you sent thank you notes to.

I think learning how to code has become more accessible than before which makes it a great avenue for facilitating diversity in tech. Although that is not the underlying topic which the book discusses, rather the new \"Knowledge Era\" we live in as a result of technological innovation, this book really got me thinking a lot about \"coding as a superpower\" which Jeremy and Ashu have talked about at Make School.\n\nI'm a big proponent of <#CCMPNFPFH|blockchain> and feel that, in the right hands, it can be a tool for systemic change (this book also mentions blockchain/crypto at the end), but feel like there's a lack of diversity in that space despite it being a great fit for making change that would in-turn fuel more diversity. As such I think that the blockchain space needs a greater variety of minds, I'd love if you guys could join the <#CCMPNFPFH|blockchain> channel as I hope to encourage more discussion related to this in the coming months.\n\nIf the book piques your interest (its like a 3-4 hour read) and you give it a shot, lmk I'd love to talk about it.<https://www.blackenterprise.com/black-woman-scientist-discovered-twitter/><@Duncan MacDonald> has left the channel<@Sunny Ouyang> has left the channelaye aye<@Phyllis Wong> has left the channelYeeeIs anybody in here??

Church_ lab at Harvard University (one of the biggest contemporary names in genomics) that just showed that CRISPR - originally a tool too precise to do more than one gene edits at a time - can effectively make *over 13,000 edits at once* to a single cell. :scissors: :microscope:\n\nIn context, that's kind of like if you were using `Command + F` to _find_ a single instance of some character in your code, when one day, someone tells you about how you can use `Command + F` to *_find all and replace_*: one single button click to change hundreds, thousands, and potentially even more characters at once. :computer: :writing_hand::skin-tone-5:\n\nThis is *HUGE*. :shocked_face_with_exploding_head: We are getting dramatically closer with each passing day to a day where we'll be able to *directly edit our genomes at large scale*.

Basically its an issue with sending a post request via axios to use the mongoose validation to display errors on the client side instead of redirecting.ohh faith you can use a pattern matching like `match: [/.+@.+\\..+/, \"Please enter a valid e-mail address\"]` for email and the brcypt compare method ` bcrypt.compare(password, this.password, (err, isMatch)` for password. Idk if this helps <@Faith Chikwekwe>I dont think y'all are understanding my question. If there is anyone who can help me in person, I would appreciate that.I don\u2019t think Axios, itself, does validation. There are many approaches to validation. Validator looks like a good package, but if its just for your email, then it isn\u2019t necessary. You could use regexes that people have already built.

This is so if a pr existing file with the same name exists it will only append to it and not create a new one.\n\nBy doing so you can monitor the status of your application within the terminal and still log everything to a file for potential later purposes without any other code!:+1:Say hello to new Make School member, Juliet!\nThanks to the VA, I was able to get a service animal.\nShe's in the process of being trained :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nShe's an 8 month old Border Collie/Australian Cattle dog mix.

It's a-lot slower to retrieve elements from memory that are not stored contiguously. Most other languages that automatically manage memory from my understanding manage that memory on the heap.<@Marianne Rogoff [Writing]> has joined the channelHmm I'm curious how much more efficient the 1d array is.. According to this stack overflow, 2D arrays are converted to one strip of memory in C, implementing a method like yours. But the 2d array is basically syntactic sugar. Maybe the difference in performance is big in JS? \n\n<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1242705/performance-of-2-dimensional-array-vs-1-dimensional-array>\nSo I learned a trick that's pretty simple for implementing a multi-dimensional array. In most contexts a single dimensional array is far more efficient that a multi-dimensional array. For example say we have the following code to set every element in a 2d array to the number 2:\n```\nvar array = [5][5];\nfor (var i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) {\n    for (var j = 0; j &lt; 5; j++) {\n        array[i][j] = 2;\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code be optimized using a 1d array with the following code:\n```\nvar array = [25];\nfor (var i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) {\n    for (var j = 0; j &lt; 5; j++) {\n        array[j + i * 5] = 2;\n    }\n}\n```\nAs you can see by conceptualizing how this array can be folded down into one long array we are able to do the same operation with a little bit of math. To me it's interesting that the concept of multi-dimensional arrays is taught and methods like this aren't even mentioned when it's really just making something that is not natural to how a computer stores information and putting it in a visual representation that matches what a person can more easily comprehend (like a grid).<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHBcVlqpvZ8&amp;feature=share>this page lets you find faculty by department: <https://secure.dominican.edu/query/directory.php>\n\n\u2026if you select \u201cApplied Computer Science\u201d in the dropdown box you\u2019ll find our very own Make School instructors :slightly_smiling_face:If you email one of the professors listed on the research page, they will probably just point you to the person with the right information though.wait\u2026 thats the wrong Dominican University lmao, my bad. Apparently theres a Dominican University in IllinoisThis is definitely a strong start \u2013 thanks Nathan! My goal is to try and identify professors within the biological sciences that have ongoing research projects, but unfortunately none of the professors seem to have any of that particular information on their pages. I\u2019ll keep looking though!This is definitely pretty random, but I would love anyone\u2019s help if they got a minute with just navigating the Dominican University site. I\u2019m trying to find a catalog for professor-led research projects or a directory with all the relevant professors at the university.\n\nSo far, I\u2019ve only been able to find the Undergraduate Research page (<https://www.dominican.edu/academics/research>) but I\u2019d love to find a directory where I can access different professors by department.\n\nIf anyone\u2019s got 5-10 minutes to kill, I\u2019d definitely appreciate it, because I cannot find a directory like that anywhere on the site.<https://www.humblebundle.com/store> winter sale :DCool, but the video omitted Lovelace, Turing, Godel, and Zuse.This video explains the origins of coding and is a good reminder of what coding is: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7ZmPYaXoic>Product Hunt's was especially rewardingi recently bought a new cable for my harddrive (previous stopped working) and rediscovered my trophy collection of services that I broke (in a span of a few months - for some reason i am CONSTANTLY breaking web apps) Pics in the thread.

I would try a hamburger menu with text to right of the logos within the menu I think that\u2019ll look sleeker for mobile, also a small simple footer would be nice as well :) It\u2019s all good!

It\u2019d be nice if the buttons also had textThe one thing I noticed was that the login page and sign up button weren't centered. Then for the login page, some of the colors obstruct the Sign-Up and some or the other text which makes it more difficult to read. \n\nMaybe use lighter blues or more transparency on the circles since it seems like there is a lot going on and the call to action buttons seem a little bit small. \n\n<!here> If anyone has a second to give me feedback on my new design for FoodPrint, I would love the feedback :heart:.

Well normally people buy a gift within a certain price range, them you draw numbers from a hat. \n\nIt's most beneficial to have the highest number as you go last. \nUsually an item can only be stolen twice. Thus locking it in to whomever has it at that point. It's kind of a fun game of strategy since not all gifts are as good as others. :100: I've shown this off to several of my programmer friends :grin:This is awesome.

Obvious writes for LinkedInRIP Stan Lee<@Dylan Finn> You're living here too lmaoGreat snippet. Thanks. Keep em coming.I was planning on buying a .info anyways... but it's still kinda funny someone bought my name and hosted an empty angular site on it.Useful snippet of the day: When using a for loop to iterate through an array in the event you need the index in javascript like so `for(var i = 0;i &lt; array.length; i++)`, consider the performance increase of changing the above to read like so `for(var i = 0, l = array.length;i &lt; l;i++)`. Why is this faster? Because in the second method, we are saving the length once at the start of the loop and then iterating. In the first (traditional) method we are checking the length each iteration.I was just talking about this with someone! :joy: Just realized I picked the one substance that doesn't become more dense as a solid, so scratch what I said. Of course, none of us would be here if it didYea and because I bought the bitcoin in 2013 it technically cost me less than a cent.

From the look of it, it sends a \"yes\" at 17 Hz and a \"no\" at 15 Hz of EEG power, which is pretty low bandwidth. I don't think EEGs and transcranial magnetic stimulation can physically transfer much greater bandwidth than this (I could be wrong). A major drawback with EEGs is they're basically just a vector sum of all neurons firing in a region, which doesn't relay much information about what the neurons are communicating.

The Supreme Court is the most important court in the country, and its members serve for life. They make important decisions that impact how laws are applied and can shut down laws and government actions they feel violate the constitution.\n\nBrett Kavanaugh has been accused of lying to Congress in regards to whether he was aware of stolen e-mails from the Democratic party during his time working for President George W. Bush, and has also been accused of attempting to sexually assault a woman when he was in high school.\n\nThe US Senate will be voting on whether Kavanaugh shall be made a Supreme Court Justice. Current rules in the Senate require a simple majority, which seems likely to occur as the Republican party has enough votes. Many people are protesting this, feeling that Kavanaugh is not a suitable candidate for the Supreme Court, and are hoping that enough Senators change their mind and vote against Kavanaugh, requiring President Trump to find another Supreme Court nominee.\u201dHey I know politics usually always leads to arguments but I've been watching some YouTube vids on this whole Kavanaugh thing cuz of all the protests I've seen this week... but I still don't get it, i kind of get it but I don't think I know the whole story.. anyone wanna inform me on what's happening?<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRse5I_p7tA>Try catch everything alwaysI'm down, if there's roomAmy Young\u2019s Geology Class takes on SF! :muscle::skin-tone-3: :earth_asia:#tabletennis<https://www.change.org/p/marc-benioff-turn-salesforce-tower-into-eye-of-sauron-on-hallowe-en-night>EyyyyIs anybody looking to make their phone bill cheaper.

I don\u2019t know how this compares to signing up with a referral, but if you get the 40% discount, you can get 20 lunches for about $4 each.

If so, please return to me! Thanks!We almost subleased over the Summer because we thought we would be moving to Dominican.\n\nWe ended up staying in SF because we received the Living ISA over Summer if we did Summer classes.\n\nDefinitely talk to Braus or Megan though. They were both very helpful when we were going through that.I have done that and still do it, it\u2019s about establishing boundaries and rules that are simple while been real. The more order maniac you are the less I recommend you ever doing this and know who is moving in, what they do and what they are used to doing, if you don\u2019t agree in a key feature of that person like they work until very late or wake very early don\u2019t bother. Understand that everyone does have different schedules, habits and ways of doing things, if any is something unberable to you, don\u2019t do that to yourself. If any of the things previously mentioned bothers you don\u2019t do it. Also if your plan is to leave them with the room while you are out, take all your things into somewhere else or a closed spaced that can be closed and is not just laying around. Things might break, drinks spilled, relationships and many things, so be ready for the worst but trust the people for the best. I have subleased to 6 people so far in different intervals of time and it\u2019s been a good experience. Also be aware that if you are living with other people have their opinion on mind and talk with them before every decision.Does anyone have experience subleasing a room in SF over summer and what was your experience like?

I have only bad news and no good news at all. The hurricane is currently strengthening and will continue to strengthen for the upcoming days. Every one of our hurricane models that are respectable among us meteorologists is showing this as a category four hurricane or even a five as it approaches the coast. I have never seen all of these hurricane models agree on such a huge increase in hurricane speed and size in all my years as a meteorologist. In short, every variable that we would look for to predict if a hurricane will blow up into a monster is being met with this particular storm. There is now a 95% chance this storm will directly strike somewhere along the Carolina coast between Charleston South Carolina and Nags Head North Carolina. The current prediction is that it will come ashore with winds between 135mph and 150 mph with higher gusts. We can only hope that it will be weaker than that but that\u2019s the current forecast and scientific thinking. Hurricane Hugo striking Charleston South Carolina in 1989 would be a similar type. I surveyed the damage and saw destruction like you could not believe. I do not know what part of the coast will experience this type of destruction but when the eye of the storm comes ashore, I\u2019m sure it will be horrific. If the storm is this powerful when it comes ashore, it will have the ability to completely blow down houses that are not made of strong brick or concrete. I want to emphasize that this would occur if the storm is that strong and only in the small area where the eye comes ashore. The storm surge with such a storm could reach 10 to 15 feet above normal water levels and could easily go inland several miles depending on what part of the coast it strikes. The secondary danger that could be even worse is what I alluded to several days ago. Once the storm comes ashore it will stall for at least three or four days and this could bring such flooding to boggle the imagination and could rival the flooding of Houston last year in areas north and north west of where the center gets stuck inland. The exact location of that flooding cannot be determined until we know where the storm stalls. All areas from northern South Carolina North Carolina and Virginia (including inland spots)need to be very vigilant and watch the forecast daily. I have been a meteorologist in Virginia for almost 30 years and this very well may be the most serious threat I have seen to life and property since starting my career in 1987. Not all areas in these three states will experience what I am speaking about. We don\u2019t know which areas yet will get slammed until we know where it I will come ashore and where it stalls out. I will update again tomorrow and I cannot take questions sorry. Do remember there is still a 5% chance that it may stall just out to sea and sit and eventually move away and there is still a chance, though not very great, that the storm is only a category two or three which would still be horrible but not catastrophic.\"Oh yeah I already said that.I bought one for 85 dollars.Blah!!<@Jamie McCrory> dm me and I can bring tomorrowI have one I can give you<@Briant (Elliot) Oliveira>  email <mailto:Alan@wakatime.com|Alan@wakatime.com> and make sure you put Make School student in the subject.

You can definitely track that on some graph and get some kind of analysisi think they're these ones: <https://smile.amazon.com/Modway-Articulate-Ergonomic-Office-Chair/dp/B006IY89ZA/> but I'm not 100% sureI've been keeping track of the colds going around so if any of you are sick this weekend here are some tips:\n\nCold A - for the major runny nose that turns into irritable dry-nose: this one should only last a day max but it can turn into a sinus and/or ear infection. Take a long bath, put a warm washcloth on your face, take nyquil or something if you can't sleep\n\nCold B- for the nasty sore throat + mild runny nose: if it's stopping you from sleeping properly you can take nyquil or something to suppress the symptoms at night, cough drops near your bed and lots of water\n\nCold C - for the wet cough: this can turn into bronchitis which will suck if you have to go up a lot of stairs. Breathing exercises and stretching really seemed to help for me\n\nCold D - for the major fatigue + headache: please just sleep all day and don't try to use your sick day to go grocery shopping like I did\n\nIn general, get rest, drink water, #self-care and all that.\nI'm not 100% sure these are all distinct colds but a lot of you that I've talked to seem to have gotten one or two of these specific symptom clusters. Even if you haven't gotten sick yet just remember to wash your hands and take whatever scientifically ambiguous immune boosters work for you (I like zinc and sometimes Echinacea tea seems to work).

I thought you meant the Vantaggio hotel :woman-facepalming: Stuff sent to Vantaggio = okay, Make School itself = no (as far as I know)Specifically android stuff is here: <https://github.com/OrangeCoastCollege-CS273>I have a few projects on my github: <http://github.com/Seve|github.com/Seve>I\u2019ll be there!Cop stuff!! Not sure what the lead\u2019s code base is, like if their existing code is java or intelliJ but perhaps you an I could meet! Are you attending the dinner tomorrow evening??Android dev was a blast.  I\u2019m a huge intellij fan so Android Studio was great to work with.  I feel like everything was straight forward on mechanics but I still had some room to move around and do my own thing.How did people used to apologize back in the day? Yup! I've gotten Amazon packages delivered here. (Obviously) just make certain your name's on it :slightly_smiling_face:Well good sir! Nice to meet ya, can I ask, how did you feel about developing for android? I ask because I have another PC student that has a potential lead on a job position.Does anyone know if students can ship their packages to Make School? (such as amazon)I\u2019ve got about a semester worth of android dev experienceMine at 835 Turk areAnyone do native android development???<@Ikey Benzaken> has joined the channel<@Daniel Zhu> has joined the channelDoes anyone know if the ethernet port(s) in the Vantaggio Abigail are live?I'm not entirely sure with that. I'm sure they email you and will just ask for like maybe proof you live here or at the Vantaggio. It's hard to say but you can also just pay the $12 for the first two hours if you wanted to do that.   I'm sure you can look up how they may do that since I feel it would be a common question from those in the city. How do they check your California residency?If anyone is looking to travel around the city by themselves that want more transportation options than just Uber and Lyft, you can try scoot. You get 2 free hours of scoot time for signing up. You have to watch some videos about safety and rules regarding the app but it's a pretty convenient thing depending on the time of day and your comfortability using an electric scooter. \n\nYou can use my link to sign up as well :)\n\n<https://app.scoot.co/#sign_up?promo_code=ANWARA1&amp;suo=hKdc&amp;sel=19//>\n\nWhen you sign up and enter your billing info, it will throw a thing saying the free 2 hours is only for residents but there is an option to say you ARE a resident, since you live here now and just click that :)Oh fr fr Super Duper was pretty good good I give it a 7.5 maybe!Super Duper is my recommendationI'll probably pass; just watch out for Turk st, things get weird right about nowSorry for the late reply - headed out rn just gonna google something there\u2019s so many here it\u2019s glorious lolWhere at?Gonna go find a good burger if anybody\u2019s wants to come along at 8Gotcha!

Not that it always will, but it can certainly contribute to these thingsI think that's the point of the article Julia. You enjoy using code to solve your other problems. Your code is something you are passionate about. Having something you are passionate about and engaged in is important to being a fulfilled human being. The article, I perceived, is just arguing against faceless corporations pushing solely for the types of people who code passionately, or possibly even to the exclusion of other passions. Not every job requires \"the best\" programmer, just as many jobs do not require \"the best\" plumber or \"the best\" electrician. The vast majority of jobs can be solved by competent X's.

I think I left it towards the front of the great Hall where I usually sit. It has an orange backpack sticker on one side and a space/planet sticker on the other (they're stickers from the epic GitHub meetup). If the stickers fell off somehow or were taken off, another distinguishing trait is its exceptionally knotty/messed up wire that's tinged with yellow for some reason.

If you have it--please DM me!!Has anyone seen my lunchbox? Its grey with white polka dots. I completely lost track of it after eating lunch yesterday!Was there a make school notebook with a samsung sticker turned in?\nIt has my name on the first page as well!Found this ring on the bathroom sink downstairs.

Looks just like a Mac charger, but is black and has the hp logo on the block.Blue jacket for sureMine tooThank you!! We Appreciate it! \nHope my laptop charger is in there! Because of the size of the event this weekend, we did some cleaning last night to assure the space was set up for Startup Weekend. If you left anything over the weekend, its very likely I put it in the Lost-and-Found on the staff side. Found quite a few chargers, water bottles, and a couple of jackets and miscellaneous items.<@Erik Perez> has left the channelTwo chargers, black sunglasses and a make school notebook were left in the quiet room downstairs. They're in lost and found now.Lol found itguys am literally the only person with an asus omfgAnyone seen a black asus charger?\"somehow\"Hey somehow someones Mac book charger ended inside my back pack in the Great Hall, so if you're missing your Mac charger, i placed it in the lost and found.Nvm, found itHey, I think someone mistakenly took my laptop charger from my bag during the enrollment session.

This week\u2019s coding challenges are somewhat shorter so you have time to draft your article by next week.<@Alan Davis [CS]> does this apply to the 3:30 section as well? just asking because several of us were discussing this and were surprised that the outline\u2019s due todayI did a thing.

Do we just find/make up a question involving permutations? I was trying to do it, but I'm unsure how to approach it.You\u2019re correct. A is the intent of those problems and B is to check your results.After consideration, I'm assuming you want us to (A) convert first, then sum, since we all know how to sum base 10, and we already have a different exercise that asks us to convert base 10 to two's complement(Obviously the result is the same, just wondering what the intent was)hey <@Alan Davis [CS]>, can I get some clarity on what you want us to do in this stretch challenge question?\n&gt;\"Add the following 8-bit twos' complement numbers\"\n&gt; 54(base10) + -32(base10)\n\nThe numbers are not 8-bit two's complement, they are decimal numbers. So, did you want us to:\n\n(A) convert the decimal numbers\n&gt;54(base10) and -32(base10)\ninto two's complement numbers, and then sum them?\n\nOr\n\n(B) did you want us to sum them in base 10 and then convert the result into an 8-bit two's complement?Reminder: :pencil: You need to *submit your completed number bases worksheet* on Monday for completion credit. *Binary and hexadecimal numbers* are required challenges, whereas the negative numbers (signed magnitude, one\u2019s complement, and two\u2019s complement) sections are optional stretch challenges. <!channel>Raymond Hettinger is a legendary core developer of Python.

Please start class by discussing and reviewing Call Routing Project solutions. <!here>Friendly reminder: I didn\u2019t give new challenges on Friday to let you focus on the Call Routing Project, make some progress on writing your technical articles, and catch up on past challenges. Your CS 3 priorities should be something like this:\n:one: *Technical article #1 draft is due today* \u2013 share links to your Medium article drafts in this <!channel> to *get/give feedback*\n:two: *Call Routing Project* \u2013 we\u2019ll start today\u2019s class by reviewing a few solutions and debating the merits/tradeoffs of each\n:three: *Catch up on challenges* you\u2019re behind on \u2013 you need to complete at least 80% of all challenges to pass this course\n:four: Push yourself further with *stretch challenges*, like the `TreeMap` class suggested on the *tree traversals* class pageHello everyone :wave:<@Miki Nomura [Marketing]> has joined the channelThank you for reading carefully, Ansel! :clap:Hints: \u2022 How can you validate that your solution is correct with multiple carriers?\n\u2022 How can you estimate performance will scale before you have _all_ the data?Yeah, I only generated one carrier routes list since it was so large, but could generate more if you really want them. How would you test scenario 3 and 4 with only one carrier deck? (I was only given one when I started working on this problem at Twilio.)How would you validate your solution\u2019s correctness when you don\u2019t have an answer key of \u201ccorrect\u201d results given to you by an \u201coracle\u201d? (in the real world, there are no answer keys)We will review your implementations of the `Set` class and its operations (methods) in class today. So come prepared!If we couldn\u2019t find a +12 or a +1, we would write 0 to the text file. You can find this information at the bottom of the second page of the project .pdf under \u2018Output Data\u2019.If we have a phone num say `+123` that doesn't match perfectly with any route but let's say there is a route with `+124` and `+122` which cost do we return? or in that example would the cost be `0` since it didn't match perfectly?Also for scenario 3 you say we need 5 5carrier route lists with 10mil routes each but there is only one 10mil list on dropbox. Can you please clarify?Can we see your results files so we can check ours against the correct ones? <@Alan Davis [CS]>Was there class today? I thought the teachers had a trip or something.Thank youI recommend you write your code in a subfolder of your CS 3 repo, like `routing` and add the data files to a subfolder that you can tell Git to ignore by adding a line like `routing/data/` to your `.gitignore` file and committing that change. This is the simplest way to keep the files in your repo but not commit them (that caused Elliot a Git headache yesterday).Please *DO NOT* download _all_ data files from the Dropbox link all at once. It seems that my account was throttled last night. Just download the small files (&lt; 1 MB) to get started and download the bigger files when you\u2019re trying to solve the later scenarios (i.e., tougher challenges). This should distribute the large file downloads through time enough.Here are the instructions and links to data files for the *Call Routing Project* to work on together (collaborate!) in class today <!channel>: <https://github.com/Product-College-Courses/CS-3-Core-Data-Structures/blob/master/Class6.md>don\u2019t make the same mistake I did lol, it took <@Alan Davis [CS]> at least 30 min to fix it for me #SavedbytheRainbow :alan::rainbow:FYI guys, if you download the files, DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT commit them to your git! And the files to your git ignore because they are way to big and will crash every time you try to push because you need to pay to store these kind of files<https://www.dropbox.com/sh/tj6ppp6uwf12cce/AADje96PJhfsIXJEtP1OjwjFa><@Juan Hurtado> yes I see the image you posted.

I got a message on slack saying there is no more storage space left.I am getting a 404 error when attempting to view the data sets for the routing project <@Alan Davis [CS]>Here\u2019s a Venn diagram illustrating the Set operations `union`, `intersection`, `difference` (like Swift\u2019s `subtracting`): <https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Art/setVennDiagram_2x.png>Sets are also part of Swift too! <https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/CollectionTypes.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH8-ID490>Show me the code tomorrow before or after class and I can help guide your self-discovery.For 100,000 items it runs the fastest with a load_capacity of 0.8. However for 1,000,000 it runs fastest with a load_capacity of 1. Is our resize method that inefficient or did I not implement it properly? <@Alan Davis [CS]>For the record, today I triple-dog-dared Tony to implement an alternative collision-resolution strategy for Hash Tables and then benchmark the results to properly analyze the performance tradeoffs of this strategy compared to chaining. Another interesting benchmark would be to tune the threshold value of `load_factor` that should trigger a `resize`.\n\nHere\u2019s how the Python core language developer Tim Peters proposed a new sorting algorithm with benchmarks that would later be named _Timsort_ in his honor: <https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2002-July/026837.html>\n\nYou grow when you push yourself beyond your comfort zone of skills and abilities by tackling greater challenges. :muscle::seedling:I think I completed all the baseline challenges and updated the tracker. :thinking_face:See message above ^ <@Egon Fiedler> <@Juan Hurtado> <@Matthew Harrilal> <@Phyllis Wong> <@Rohan Mishra> <@Sky Xu> <@Sunny Ouyang> <@Uchenna Aguocha>Based on the tracker, it looks like about half the class was able to complete the *Stacks &amp; Queues* challenges due today.

I\u2019ve had the flu for over a week. I\u2019m going to be late to class.<@Alan Davis [CS]> can you push the latest homework as soon as you get a chance please! Thanks!So I was sitting around annoyed as to why the run time of merge sort (using slices) was one-fourth the speed of merge sort2 (using only two lists) and was wondering if I was doing something wrong since 4x is a lot. Then I checked the competition.\n\n<https://puu.sh/ywpb0/6d74e580bb.png>\nEDIT: Missing cocktail, at ~15s\n\nAssuming I did implementation right (~I sure hope so~ Nope, see EDIT3), my gut reaction is to say \u201cI guess you can\u2019t have it both ways\u201d. Even though it\u2019s 4x slower, that\u2019s still like approx 20x faster than the next fastest (0.4s vs insertion sort at 8.0s). Space wise, assuming 10k items, that\u2019s\nmerge1 = n * log2(n) = 132,877 slots of memory \nmerge2 = n = 10,000 slots of memory\n\nThat\u2019s like\u2026 7% of the original merge\u2019s memory.\n\nEDIT2:\n<https://puu.sh/ywq7D/4099eefa91.png>\nFound the issue of slowness. Wanted to fix it after realizing that it got unbearable 100k and up, getting into seconds. I just needed to update certain things instead of everything in the array at once. \n\nThe original point is moot, merge2 superior unless you really want that fraction of a second. Keep in mind these are like 500,000 items for both. At that point, we\u2019re talking 500,000 slots of memory vs ~9,465,784.\n\nEDIT3:\n<https://puu.sh/ywJ4y/bc7ac5476f.png>\n\nmerge2 (without slices) the best<@Alan Davis [CS]> will you update the spreadsheet?<http://sortmylist.com/>you can use this to clean the character lists a bit<https://www.random.org/strings/>they also have strings :scream:for all of our unit tests, a place to generate long lists of numbers :grimacing: \n<https://www.random.org/integer-sets/>Hey everyone, this is my current draft for my first article.

I pushed updated challenges to the course repo <!here>: <https://github.com/Product-College-Courses/CS-3-Core-Data-Structures/blob/master/Class3.md#challenges>Yes. I\u2019m beginning to remove some of the training wheels\u2026 :wink::seedling:Are we suppose to create our own file for the search in a string?You may run into a merge conflict, but resolving it shouldn\u2019t be too hard and will be practice for when you have to do that and it\u2019s more complicated and on code that really matters! Remember to read the instructions/hints Git provides.If you\u2019ve already started on the challenges that Maribel shared above, I recommend you commit your current work and then `git pull course master` to get the starter code, which will be in `palindromes.py` and I\u2019ve updated this year.I just pushed the string algorithm challenges to the course repo. Sorry for my delay, I was working on a template for the string searching functions, then had to switch gears for lightning talks and forgot to go finish that and push. <!channel>I can share my template if you wantIt seems like he wants you to create your own test cases but I think he had a templateBut for the pattern in string ones, I just created my ownI would just do the palindrome ones based on the ones Maribel gaveI wish I had his numberanyone have <@Alan Davis [CS]>\u2019s number so we could like text him and just get him to push the challenges lolI made a template file file for in string stuff if yall want itKnow what are the correct challenges?no we don\u2019t, but it\u2019s a start :sweat_smile:Only question is, do we know that they are the correct challenges?Np, glad I could help!Thanks again!

Thank's so much Maribel!From the Markdown file Readme: \n\"- write your own unit tests for your string searching functions\n    - include several test cases that are both positive (examples) and negative (counterexamples)\"I just checked. Looks like those are the only 2 files given for this assignment. My guess is that we write those ourselves, because we are also learning how to work with unit testsI also wonder if he wants us to do those challenges both iteratively and recursivelyOr do we create those files ourself?For the challenges: \"Find if pattern occurs in string\", \"Find index of pattern in string\", \"Tests for finding pattern in string\"Oh wait we might need another(deleted extra files to avoid confusion)Np!I think you're right Avery, it looks like the palindrome file is all we needOh thanks so much!Sorry for the delay. I was getting the links for you allOh those are the search algorithms. Do you have the finding if a character is in a string?I think I found themNo problem. I saw your message, just searching through at the momentAlso thanks so much for the filesDo you have the string challenge files?Just keep in mind that these will be different from the versions that he has created for this yearDo you also have the string challenge files?I did, thanks for catching that. Let me fixWas one of them suppose to be a pytest file?You send the same file twicedoes this help?Yeah I was creating a template on my one but that might be bettermy suggestion would be to create a new branch off masterI can share the template from last year's Data Structures class. The problem is, folks will probably deal with merge conflicts when it's pushed the main repoWe can make a template and just transfer everything to his once he pushes itNot sure <@Avery Durrant>, but I\u2019d hate to lose a whole day or skip the challenges over it :confused: was kinda looking forward to them!Should we just make a template if he doesn't push it in a few hours?Yeah I can\u2019t pull them either!<@Alan Davis [CS]> have you pushed the code for the challenges due tomorrow?Should we do the class code review that we look at one persons code?I'm running a little late.

That being said, it is *VERY highly recommended* to be reading articles/posts outside of class on ML algorithms.\n\nFor example, here is a fantastic article explaining the ML alg we\u2019ll be introducing in class today.

Thanks for sharing! Hello everyone, I was trying to better understand precision and recall, and I found a very helpful diagram on Wikipedia - <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall>This would cause that sort of variation, because it\u2019s grabbing a different sample for training vs testing every time. That means the neighbors it has access to for each point will change with every time. At a glance, I\u2019m guessing this is because you\u2019re running train test split each time along with the code. Same thing happens with the SKLearn version though, so maybe it is intended behavior (?)To anyone who has completed the KNN challenge: Are you guys getting the same result or different results for accuracy score when you run the code multiple times for the same k value? \nWhen I run the code several times for a given k value, I get different values each time, within a range of each other. But it seems to me that this shouldn't be the case, since any given data point doesn't change its neighborsInteresting article regarding design and its role in data science: <https://hbr.org/2018/03/what-happens-when-data-scientists-and-designers-work-together><@Tia (TJ) King> has left the channelI created a *DS 2 challenge tracker* to organize all the resources and give you a clear window on your progress. <!channel><@Alan Davis [CS]> pinned their GSuite Spreadsheet <https://makeschoolstudents.slack.com/files/Alan Davis [CS]/F9HRJJZ8R/ds_2__machine_learning_progress__term_4_|DS 2: Machine Learning Progress (Term 4)> to this channel.Here\u2019s a great info graphic I found that summarizes the different subfields of AI used within data science.

Using a statistic called AUC (in which a score of 1.0 signifies 100% accuracy), the ACC/AHA guidelines hit 0.728. The four new methods ranged from 0.745 to 0.764, Weng\u2019s team reports this month in PLOS ONE. The best one\u2014neural networks\u2014correctly predicted 7.6% more events than the ACC/AHA method, and it raised 1.6% fewer false alarms.

Feel free to do this in the same jupyter notebook as your decision tree.  How do they compare?\n3)  Create another jupyter notebook from scratch.  Use a naive bayesian classifier (gaussianNB) to to classify samples from the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Study data set.  You can load this dataset directly from sklearn.datasets, or you can download it from the UCI machine learning data set repository.  Clean, prepare, visualize, and classify the dataset just like we did with the titanic and iris data sets.  You will be presenting your findings in Tuesday\u2019s class!\n4)  As prework for the next class, reread the article you looked at for Bias/Variance, but this time pay special attention to the K-Nearest-Neighbors algorithm in the second half of the article.  See if you can get a feel for how you would write this--this is one the simpler algorithms we\u2019ll work with in ML.  The link to the article is in the syllabus, but here\u2019s a copy of it to save you some time:  <http://scott.fortmann-roe.com/docs/BiasVariance.html>^^When you\u2019re listening to EDM?when is this graph useful?Bruh :open_mouth: :clap:Anybody go the extra mile and try visualizing their decision tree, or their decision surfaces across certain classes?FYI <!channel>: Unfortunately, Arbital has changed their page IDs in the past 48 hours and confused us.

You could be the one to crack the case of the serial killer that hunts NFL prospects to try and close the wage gap in a misguided attempt to make it so more women can afford MTG cards and South Park DVDs.  #YouNeverKnowThese are great for practicing, seeing how others use ML in the wild, and building your portfolio of work for data science/ML.<https://www.kaggle.com/murderaccountability/homicide-reports><https://www.kaggle.com/mylesoneill/magic-the-gathering-cards><https://www.kaggle.com/tovarischsukhov/southparklines><https://www.kaggle.com/jonavery/incomes-by-career-and-gender>For example:  <https://www.kaggle.com/ronaldjgrafjr/nfl-draft-outcomes>If you haven\u2019t taken a look at some of the data sets available on kaggle, you\u2019re missing out!Find me at the couches in the basement if you need help with anything or just want to talk about data science/ML!running a bit late, my office hours will be 1030-12 today.Not sure if everyone caught it last week, but <@Mike Kane [DS]> mentioned checking out the Data Skeptic podcast - I had the chance to listen to a few episodes and it is spectacular - definitely should check it out! :fire:<@Alan Davis [CS]> pinned a message to this channel.<@Alan Davis [CS]> pinned <@Mike Kane [DS]>\u2019s CSV <https://makeschoolstudents.slack.com/files/Mike Kane [DS]/F4PBX3P5G/aq_data_sets.csv|AQ_data_sets.csv> to this channel.<@Alan Davis [CS]> pinned a message to this channel.<@Alan Davis [CS]> pinned their Zip <https://makeschoolstudents.slack.com/files/Alan Davis [CS]/F4NAT5ARM/ml_day1_challenge.zip|ML_Day1_Challenge.zip> to this channel.<@Alan Davis [CS]> pinned their Zip <https://makeschoolstudents.slack.com/files/Alan Davis [CS]/F4QKX1VFZ/ml_day2_challenge.zip|ML_Day2_Challenge.zip> to this channel.<@Alan Davis [CS]> pinned a message to this channel.I\u2019m sorry that Mike and I didn\u2019t share the Jupyter notebook containing the challenges with you after class last Thursday. We both dropped the ball because we thought the other person was going to share it in the course plan (<http://make.sc/mlp|make.sc/mlp>). I\u2019ve made sure all the challenges and pre-work have been added there. Please download and work through this Jupyter notebook on Accuracy, Bias, and Variance: <https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2yuJ6N7iwDbSTZpRlB2dy1hWTQ/view>All together, these should take you about 90 minutes.  Remember that you also need to have explored the data set I posted above, AQ_data_sets.csv.  We\u2019ll begin class on Tuesday by exploring your methodologies for importing and exploring these data sets.  You should fully plan on having to show off your code for this during Tuesday\u2019s class.  Let me know if you have any questions about anything\u2014I\u2019m here to help!Thanks, Julia\u2014ask and you shall receive!\n\n*Prework for day 3: Decision Tree Classifiers*\n\n1.  Check out this tutorial on decision trees:  <http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/>  \n2.  Work through this free tutorial from data camp to build a decision tree and submit your results to kaggle.  <https://www.datacamp.com/community/open-courses/kaggle-python-tutorial-on-machine-learning#gs.3Sre3OM>\n\n*Notes on the prework:*\n\n--The tutorial on decision trees from r2d3 has one of the coolest visualizations I\u2019ve ever seen anywhere on the internet.  You should *absolutely* take a look at it\u2014the explanations are great and visualizations will give you great intuition for what\u2019s actually happening under the hood!\n\n\u2014The free tutorial from data camp is awesome\u2014it will walk you through the full ML process from data wrangling, to ML, to model evaluation.  Plus, it will help you submit to Kaggle!  If you\u2019re really passionate about ML, start building your portfolio on Kaggle.  Kaggle is kind of like github\u2019s \u201cgreen streak\u201d\u2014it shows that you\u2019re actively working and learning, and gives you a leg to stand on when you reach out for internships or interviews.What's the prework for next class? :slightly_smiling_face:<!here|@here>: Mike and I set up our office hours and I've added them to the PC calendar (<http://make.sc/pa-calendar|make.sc/pa-calendar>):\n\u2022 Alan: :monkey_face: Mondays 5-6pm, :turtle: Tuesdays 5-6pm, and :thunder_cloud_and_rain: Thursdays 11am-12pm\n\u2022 Mike: :studio_microphone: Tuesdays 10-11:30am\n\nClick all emojis below for office hour times you're _able_ to utilize. Click :anguished: if you can't make any of them.^^This document contains four different data sets.  It\u2019s formatted a bit weird, but in our case, it will make for good practice.  The x and y coordinates for data set 1 are stored in columns x1 and y1, respectively, data set 2 in x2/y2, and so on.  Use pandas as needed to split these data sets into sets that you feel comfortable working with.  How you structure everything and what aspects of the data you choose to explore are up to you.  We\u2019ll start class 3 by examining the methodologies you all used for manipulating and exploring these data sets.  We talked briefly about how a big aspect of ML/data science is being a \u201cdata storyteller\u201d\u2014be prepared to tell the story of these data sets on Tuesday!Hey gang\u2014here\u2019s the baseline challenge for day 2:Actually I read this one: <https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/how-our-likes-helped-trump-win><!channel> , if you haven\u2019t done the prework for today\u2019s class, I recommend getting started now\u2014it takes a bit of time, and we\u2019re going to move quickly today!Here\u2019s the article that Julia mentioned during the last class:  <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/26/robert-mercer-breitbart-war-on-media-steve-bannon-donald-trump-nigel-farage>This is a really good video :slightly_smiling_face:<http://ed.ted.com/lessons/what-s-the-difference-between-accuracy-and-precision-matt-anticole>Not to be `that` guy, but there is pre-work to do before tomorrows class and personally I did not remember any mention of it at the end of class (maybe it was just me) - but maybe not - so hopefully this helps at least one of you remember that there is some good good stuff todo before class :slightly_smiling_face:Unzip that ^ into your `Machine-Learning` course folder, then activate your virtual environment and run `jupyter notebook`Jupyter notebook with today's challenges: <https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2yuJ6N7iwDbVzBvY1dRZjV2MzA/view>Hey all!  I\u2019ll be TA for this course, feel free to reach out if there\u2019s anything I can help with at any point\u2014I\u2019ll take any excuse I can get to spend a little more time geeking out over machine learning!  A couple pieces of advice before the course starts:\n\n1)  Get comfortable with your tool set, especially when it comes to cleaning and preprocessing your data sets.  Pandas is your friend.  We\u2019ll spend some time in class learning the particulars of it the first week, but not much.  The concepts here aren\u2019t anything crazy, but it\u2019ll take some deliberate practice on your part to get comfortable with this.  The data sets your work with in the wild will never be pristine\u2014you\u2019re going to have to get good at data wrangling in order to make use of all the cool ML stuff Alan is going to teach you.  \n\n2)  Brush up on your linear algebra skills.  Maybe you know it well, maybe you don\u2019t.  But either way, I\u2019m guessing its not fresh in your mind, and it will need to be pretty quickly in the coming weeks.  Alan has posted some great links to help you get the rust off., like this one:  <https://betterexplained.com/articles/linear-algebra-guide/>.  If you\u2019re looking for a more detailed run through, here\u2019s a full online course on linear algebra:  <http://immersivemath.com/ila/learnmore.html>\n\n3)  Consider taking the time to work through the \u201cMath Skills for Data Science\u201d course from Coursera.  It\u2019ll take you less than 10 hours to work through it all, and it will really help you begin thinking in a way conducive to running ML experiments.  A lot of us are missing the background in experimental design that most ML experts pick up in college\u2014if you\u2019re not super comfortable talking about statistical distributions, P-values, or RMSE, then this course will level you up pretty quickly.  This is a fundamental skill set necessary for ML.Please complete the pre-work (software installation and 5 videos + questions) tonight if you haven't yet or you won't be ready for the first day of class! <http://make.sc/machine-learning-study-guide|make.sc/machine-learning-study-guide> <!channel><http://distill.pub/?ref=producthunt>Welcome everyone!

You can make it work for you by describing your technical skills, especially in regards to your projects. \n\nEach project could have a description and a photo. The description should state the problem you solved and what technologies you used to do it. \n\nIt\u2019s a hassle to update these things but they\u2019re super important. \n\n2.) show as many professionals your website as you can and get their advice. \n\nMy own portfolio site has gone through about 6 or 7 different variants, and each time it was reviewed I took their criticism and added onto to it or took away from it.

I reached out to someone at one of my dream companies the other day and he gave me some really valuable information about the company and their internship program! I found him by just looking up the company on LinkedIn and looking for someone who I had a mutual connection with (in this case, Braus) and then asking him if he could connect us. After getting the engineer's email from Braus, I wrote him a brief email with a couple of questions and he got back to me the next day. I really encourage everyone to do the same, I kind of just did it on a whim and it only took ten minutes but I'm really glad I did it!<@Juan Hurtado> has left the channel<@Rohan Mishra> has left the channel<@Julie Hutchinson> has left the channel<@Komal Desai [Marketing]> has joined the channel<@Megan Doepker [Marketing]> has joined the channelI met with my mentor and did a code review a week ago, he\u2019s the lead IOS engineer at handshake. he inspired me on how to better organize my code and write cleaner code, and made me feel more positive about  job searching.<@Novan (Donny) Adams> pinned a message to this channel.<@Novan (Donny) Adams> pinned a message to this channel.<@Tassos Lambrou> pinned a message to this channel.I met with my mentor a few weeks and wanted to share a few things about the experience.  My mentor is a C++ engineer who has worked at Lucas Arts and Google (Google Earth/Youtube) for the past 15 years and has two companies that make IOT products. \n\nThe first thing we went over were his thoughts on the big picture approach to growing my career as an engineer.  He went through a couple of different career paths that he believes are going to be an endless field of opportunity for burgeoning engineers.\n    1. Machine Learning/AI :nerd_face:\n    2. Blockchain/Cryptocurrencies :thinking_face:\n    3. Advanced marketing and SEO technologies (Yawn :sleeping:)\n    4. Security and Dev Ops (Yawn :sleeping:)\n\nThe next part of our meeting I asked him to look at my resume and LinkedIn for feedback for improvement.  He helped me see places where I had used descriptors of myself and/or involvement on certain projects that were vague, and just general niceities that don\u2019t demonstrate my true abilities or potential as an engineer.  On projects that I worked on where I built something from end to end, it\u2019s better to speak specifically about the measurable value you brought in your working on the project/problem you solved than to just be vague and say you built everything.  He also suggested that I research and use industry jargon for the field I\u2019m going into in my descriptions.  He also suggested that I summarize my portfolio in my bio at the top of my LinkedIn to show what I\u2019m all about right up front rather than making them scroll down. Put what you can do right up front in a neat and concise way.\n\nOverall some great tips.  Hope they are helpful to you as well.<@Tassos Lambrou> pinned a message to this channel.<@Tassos Lambrou> pinned a message to this channel.<@Tassos Lambrou> pinned a message to this channel.<@Tassos Lambrou> pinned a message to this channel.<@Tassos Lambrou> pinned a message to this channel.<@Tassos Lambrou> pinned a message to this channel.<@Tassos Lambrou> pinned a message to this channel.<@Tassos Lambrou> pinned a message to this channel.<@Tassos Lambrou> pinned <@Dan Morse [SPD]>\u2019s Plain Text <https://makeschoolstudents.slack.com/files/Dan Morse [SPD]/F8UEH590C/Untitled.txt|Untitled> to this channel.<@Tassos Lambrou> pinned a message to this channel.<@Tassos Lambrou> pinned a message to this channel.<@Tassos Lambrou> pinned <@Dan Morse [SPD]>\u2019s GSuite Spreadsheet <https://makeschoolstudents.slack.com/files/Dan Morse [SPD]/F7S87GEP5/pc_mentor_list_2017-2018|PC Industry Contacts List 2018-2019> to this channel.<@Tassos Lambrou> pinned a message to this channel.<@Tassos Lambrou> pinned a message to this channel.<@Tassos Lambrou> pinned a message to this channel.Your last paragraph is gold. Thank you.I met with my mentor on Friday and she was very understanding and approachable. We talked about her experience in tech from both an engineering and a business standpoint, and she relieved a lot of my concerns about starting work as an engineer. She mentioned that it's harder to get a job in tech than it actually is to work in tech, which is something I was really concerned about.\n\nIt took a few emails to reach her, so I'm really glad I followed through even though I was hesitant to do so at first. And, not surprisingly, she emphasized the importance of networking in getting your first job!I haven't gotten around to it, but I am doing it now.I met with my second mentor last week on Thursday. He is a senior UI engineer at Netflix. We had the BEST conversation. He let me know about his career trajectory, and was very open about what it took for him to get where he is today. He is super enthusiastic about mentoring Make School students. By the end of our conversation we agreed to stay in touch and meet on a monthly basis. Even though his main languages are JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, he offered to give me code reviews and user testing feedback on any projects I am working on.\n\nSome key takeaways: all of the jobs he has had as a developer, he got because someone he knew recommended him for an interview. Every night after work, he pushed himself to level up. In the beginning, he offered trades (I build your website, for x-product you are selling). As soon as he had a few quality products in his portfolio, he landed his first developer position.\n\nI feel grateful that we got to meet. If you are having trouble getting a mentor that is a good fit for you, don\u2019t be nervous about reaching out and asking for help.Managed to talk with two mentors.\nOne used to be a Director of Software Engineering for Google Home + Motorola. Talked about video encoding, then segued to what he looks for in the software engineers he\u2019s managing. Turns out, having them do something they actually care about about does wonders on morale, productivity, and just general growth. Encouragement on things that don\u2019t seem tried and true also goes a long way. Seems like a given, but hey, you\u2019d be surprised. \n\nAnother used to be a mobile instructor for Make School and is now working at Coursera as a front-end dev. Things don\u2019t always go the way you expect, but sometimes it can lead to something you wouldn\u2019t expect to enjoy. Something to take to heart, really.\n\nIntimidating at first to call professionals, but they\u2019re typically pretty chill. Just have at it and remember they were in the same spot we were before.<https://www.fastcompany.com/40520003/three-better-ways-to-network-in-2018>\u2026\nShout out to <@Juan Hurtado>, <@Alirie Gray> and <@Ferdinand Cruz> for scheduling meetings with their mentor. #PersistancePaysOffFor the seniors - here\u2019s the old template we used to reach out to mentors on the mentorship list:\n\nTemplate:\n\n\u201cHi Jane,\nMy name is Susan and I\u2019m an engineering student at Make School\u2019s Product College. I\u2019m excited you are looking to mentor students in my class. I checked out your LinkedIn Profile and think I\u2019d get a lot out meeting 1:1 for brief coffee and learning more about your work at X Company. I\u2019d love to get your advice on my projects and the start of my job hunt.\n\nI\u2019d be happy to go to you and meet at your offices or nearby. Please let me know what\u2019s convenient for you. I\u2019m typically available Tues and Thurs from 4pm to 7pm.\n\nThank you,\nSusan\n<tel:908-799-7730|908-799-7730>\n[Linkedin]\u201dHey guys/gals, I just had THE BEST conversation with a Core UI Engineer at Google. Some good take-aways: \n\nThe work doesn\u2019t stop when you sell out to a corporate giant like Pandora, Facebook, Apple, or Google. That opens up a world of possibilities and may be the beginning, not the end, of your career in software.\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to learn the culture of those who are around you. You and your team can only benefit by seeking out perspectives on how workplace solutions and your communication may affect others. \n\nBe relentless about what you want, and go get it. There are no half measures.\n\nRemember to reach out to your mentors and have a genuine conversation with them. It will definitely keep you motivated to be great.3. Please send your emails by end of day\n4. Message Dan or Susan if you\u2019d like feedback on your message. We\u2019ve sent hundreds of emails like these over the years, so we know a thing or two about effective messaging :slightly_smiling_face:2.

Please DM me today.Hey everyone. I met with my mentor who\u2019s a senior PM. Her strong suit is using data in decision-making. She shared how she performed data analysis to gain market insights in her work. She\u2019s very smart and resourceful. We will meet once a month for our mentoring session.Hello everyone. I met with my original mentor before Open House. She was really nice and knowledgable, however I got the feeling it wasn\u2019t the right fit for either of us. We had a great discussion about EdTech, and the state of education in general. By the end of the discussion she mentioned a colleague at her company that she thought I should meet. She came to the open house, and to my knowledge is still interested in getting mentees. \n\nToday I reached out to another mentor, and he emailed me back immediately. We scheduled a meeting for next week. Moral of the story, keep trying until you find a mentor that works for you!Hi all, I\u2019ve added a few new mentors to our list, including a sr ui engineer from Netflix.\nPlease make sure your listing and status on the spreadsheet is up to date AND try reaching out to a new mentor! :slightly_smiling_face:\n<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PUffTZwaYVe3EWcCqF_2czeDV0KsEEjJzt-SIyziZVY/edit#gid=0><!here> We\u2019re thinking about instituting Mentoring Office Hours. Please :+1: if you think it would be beneficial to have regular mentor office hours. For example, a mentor would be in a conf room or floating around the main room for 1-2 hours and you could sign-up for a quick chat, code review, product demo feedback, etc. This would be in addition to the 1:1 outreach you\u2019ve been doing.In a core class soon, we\u2019ll help you connect with mentors who work in an industry / with technology aligned to your teams core project. And are _not_ on the MS mentorship list. I\u2019m looking forward to hearing how these conversations go :slightly_smiling_face:Good. I recommend you reach out to two people locally.Hey Susan, I am looking for new mentorship because honestly I feel like it would benefit me more if I had someone that is more proactive. He lives in Los Angeles and is pretty busy I'd benefit more from someone who I can meet weekly or bi weekly.will you meet again? regularly?Hey everyone, when I first spoke to my mentor I was excited to talk to him he told me about his times at Snapchat and what he did as a test engineer. It was nice talking to someone who is in industry due to it giving me some perspective on where I will be in the upcoming months hopefully. Alongside this he also told me what got him into mobile development as well as just everyday things he does to make him better at his craft!Hi everyone, my initial conversation with my mentor was via phone. We spoke for about an hour and a half. It was great. He is currently a product manager and has been for over 10 years. Since PM is a role I would like to transition to later in my career, I found it extremely valuable to gain useful information on how to best prepare for that transition. He encouraged me to contact him often and assured me I wouldn\u2019t be a bother. We are still in contact as he offers advice with UI design or career choices.Thanks Elliot! Everyone, please post your learnings in this channel after you meet. Shout out to <@Susan Nesbitt [Biz Dev]> for sourcing incredible people who want to meet YOU :slightly_smiling_face:So yesterday I met my mentor and he was very interesting, his name is Nicholas and he is one of head security for Tesla (so besides testing the web browser of Tesla, we also test the new models of the cars that are not even out yet), the coolest thing about our meeting was that besides of hacking conversation we have a common interest is astrophysics, so we also had a long conversation about Spacex and since he works closely with Elon Musk he mention to me that the new falcon will be launch to space today\u2026 Also we talked about having biweekly meeting and keeping in touch with each others progress every week. I\u2019m really excited to continue meeting him and learning more about cyber security\u2026 So I know that some of the mentors have been a flake but a word of advice: \u201cPersist!\u201dI actually just met my mentor :raised_hands::skin-tone-2:<!here> Persistence pays off. Jeff finally scheduled a meeting with his mentor after not hearing a response for 4 emails. Elliot just made contact too. Reach out to your mentor again - it\u2019s not a \u201cno\u201d until they actively say they _can\u2019t_ meet. \nIf you don\u2019t get a response, pick someone else from the list ( two posts above) and send <@Susan Nesbitt [Biz Dev]> and I their name with the  email you will send to them.

Thanks all.  <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PUffTZwaYVe3EWcCqF_2czeDV0KsEEjJzt-SIyziZVY/edit#gid=0><!here> ^ and thank you Susan for that great answer! I\u2019ll add: think of them as a professional friend and ally.*FAQ on Mentorship Meeting:* _I\u2019m having my mentor meeting tomorrow and was wondering what kind of questions I should be asking? Should I start talking about my work or jump straight into questions about their company/ professions/ etc?_\n\u2026\nGreat question. Its flexible. Ultimately, you\u2019re meeting a stranger who you know a little bit about and whom you know wants to meet you and help you in your career path. Start by researching them via LI. You may find commonalities (cities, people in common, companies you know etc.). Start the conversation by thanking them for their time to meet with you to learn more about their career path and the work they are doing today. \nTell them about what your studying, what you\u2019re building, places you think you might want to get an internship of industries and roles in general you\u2019re interested in. Ask them if they have guidance for things they would suggest you focus on to get there. If they are technical, ask them if they\u2019d be open to a quick code review/feedback session\u2026I bet if will all be a very natural conversation. In person is ideal, if you can make that happen on your end.FYI We had a senior front end engineer based in sf just added to our available mentor list. \n<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PUffTZwaYVe3EWcCqF_2czeDV0KsEEjJzt-SIyziZVY/edit#gid=0>niceReminder: tips.If you\u2019ve reached to your mentor and then pinged them with a follow up and still radio silence, consider choosing a new one, reaching out to them and making a note in the spreadsheet that there was \u201cNo response. (student name)\u201c. That will give others a heads up and offer transparency on your own efforts.

Your preferences do change over time, especially dependent on career, social life, living situation, etc. Preferences typically don\u2019t change in a week, but rather over time, which is why it\u2019s important to take the assessment without a role in mind or wishing you were a certain type. With that said, the percentages can vary when re-taking, which might indicate the direction you are starting to prefer more now than in the past. Make sense? Yep :shocked_face_with_exploding_head: .... I definitely will try in a few days. Could someone flex between I and E in a short amount of time (a day or a week)?Makes sense since you have gone between introversion and extroversion right <@Rohan Mishra> ? You could take it again now or in a few months and see what it is and also see if the percentages in preferences change :thinking_face:Really weird that if I flip the \"Extroversion,\" part of my personality to \"Introversion\", so from ENTJ to INTJ, that the name of my personality is literally the name of the SPD project I'm working on... \"The Architect\" (<https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality>).

Everybody will make their own pitch, even if you are on your own team.<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fY7qp7VHYAg9RomO5aFBkebgdy9rDxhnoWAXSgEFC3Y/edit?usp=drive_web&amp;ouid=102349547791146369642><!channel> *Tip to drive the conversations forward with your industry partner:*\n*1. - Schedule regular meetings ahead of time* to ensure you have for-certain touch points with your partner. With these, you can better plan your workflow, ensure you can clarify things with your partner, etc :calendar:\n*2. - End all conversations with action items* - end meetings by sharing what you will do and make asks for what you\u2019d like them to do. This requires some forethought of going into meetings/conversations knowing what you want and need from them. You can also close your meeting by scheduling a follow-up meetings to get the next action items rolling :baseball:.:memo:\n*3. - Make and frame your own deadlines* - a message like one below will help you set expectations, frame deliverables, and ensure you get what you need, when you need it\u2026  \u201cWe are hoping to have the idea finalized by DATE so that we have 9 weeks to build the product. We\u2019ll need X and Y done before then, so, can we schedule a 30 min call the Friday and Tuesday before the date to ensure we have everything in place?\u201d [send calendar invites]\u2026  Own your efforts to drive the collaboration forward. :star-struck:\n*4. Make asks specific* - Your partner will have a far easier time collaborating if you make your asks specific. For example, instead of saying \u201ccan you send us your data?\u201d say \u201ccan you send us data on any of the following: Demographics, #years at company \u2026 or are there any fields you capture that you can send us.\u201d The second example requires less thought and work on their end, making it easier for them to follow through.\n\u2026\nI know that working with a partner can be frustrating, but know that these are the same dynamics you\u2019ll face in the workplace, especially as you become senior engineers/PM and need to structure work for people on your team. We\u2019re getting ample practice with this, so I hope you all use it as a way to strengthen your skills in collaboration and getting sh#t done!I actually took a Software Architecture course that went over Lucidchart and honestly its amazing,  I definitely recommend itHey everyone, when it comes to drawing your ERD's I suggest you use the link and load up the desired template!

Also here are the templates you can use and spend ~15 min customizing to the specific company: <https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1YaU2leJP_X0WamTYPKCVxuCTWd3xIedvDBYGxM1jBHo/edit?usp=drive_web&amp;ouid=102349547791146369642><@Tia (TJ) King> Some sites like Angel List and LinkedIn will give you an opportunity to reach out to the recruiter directly in which case the communication is more like a short chat.  \n\nI would also add to what <@Mike Kane [DS]> said, that it depends on how much you really like the job as well.  If you really like the company and the job, taking the time to write a detailed cover letter does show you are a fit and will get you further along in the interview process if you convince them of your relevance.  I put in time on one cover letter and have a final round interview tomorrow with this company.  If you\u2019re passionate about the opportunity, taking the time to really show how you are a fit can make a difference.  Especially if it gets in the hands of the hiring manager or upper level management.\n\nHere is a cover letter I took time with.  I have a final round interview with them tomorrow.  At every turn so far when I thought the coding challenges or technical interview problems were going poorly, they kept asking me back for the next round.  I have a hunch it\u2019s because the CEO liked my cover letter.\n\n&gt;Subject: Applicant: Software Engineer (Tassos Lambrou)\n&gt; \n&gt;Dear Will:\n&gt; \n&gt;I was fortunate to have heard about your company Strive Talent through Dan Morse at Make School. I really love what your company is all about!  It combines two things I\u2019m extremely passionate about\u2026\n&gt; \n&gt;- positively disrupting postsecondary education by connecting learning to outcomes\n&gt;- promoting meritocracy by giving opportunities to those who didn\u2019t have them\n&gt; \n&gt;I also am upcoming graduate of Make School this Spring and am looking for work as a software engineer. I feel I could be a strong fit for the role you\u2019ve posted and here\u2019s why\u2026\n&gt; \n&gt;*I have experience building similar tools to the ones you\u2019re looking to!*\n&gt;This year I have been leading a team to build software that allows educators to create mastery-based rubrics for particular competencies/outcomes. These can in-turn be used by students to self-assess so that we can provide the feedback and actionable resources necessary for them to continue leveling-up.\n&gt; \n&gt;*I have experience working in growing teams and can wear many hats*\n&gt;Prior to career switching into tech I managed a small growing medical practice and know what it takes to succeed when there isn\u2019t yet a established structure/culture in place. \n&gt; \n&gt;*I believe in your product!*\n&gt;As someone who has gone through traditional education and then experienced Make School both as a student and as an instructor I can\u2019t say enough how much I believe the whole connecting students to outcomes model, has the real power to disrupt education for the better!  Part of this disruption is the shift towards competency-based learning. \n&gt; \n&gt;Regardless of whether you think I\u2019d be a fit for the role, it would be great to meet and discuss your thoughts and vision with Strive and how we could collaborate to make education better than it is today!\n&gt; \n&gt;I hope to hear from you.\n&gt; \n&gt;Sincerely,\n&gt;TassosSo do, some don't.  I find it helpful to keep a general template I can fill in as needed, just in case the company does want one.  In my experience, if you're being referred from an internal source, they don't want one.  If you're applying cold, sometimes they do.  I agree that the entire idea of cover letters is slowly dying, as most companies nowadays have you apply online, and just feed your resume through an applicant tracking system.  However, for the companies out there that do want it, it's helpful to have one.  If it increases your chances of landing a job, even incrementally, I wouldn't consider it a waste of your time.LegitDo you need to send a cover letter if they don\u2019t require it? So many recruiters say that they don\u2019t look at them and I don\u2019t want to waste my time lolhere's an interesting article for solving permutation: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap%27s_algorithm>Core B mock interview practice problems for today:\n\n<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Yre0sihpwnhBZqcWbzXNF9b9_O58awQxl1rAo650slg/edit>Time warning! :stopwatch::warning: Parter B stop solving, Partner A share your feedback, then clear out of the basement. <!channel>Time warning! :stopwatch::warning: Parter A stop solving and Partner B share your feedback.

Use this instead of `FROM node:8`\n2. `EXPOSE 8080` is not needed since you are publishing the port with the run command (EXPOSE only exposes the port within the daemon to other running containers and not the host)\n3. `docker run -p 3000:8080 --name node` don't forget to name your container (-t only tags it in case you want to push the image to docker hub)ahhhBig shoutout to <@Nicolai Safai> for hooking us up with these amazing tickets!! :smile:<!channel> Just a reminder I am having office hours in Great Hall from now until 3:30!you have to press `ctrl-p` and then `ctrl-q`Oh wait, i figured it out`ctrl + q` works for me. Maybe it's different for mac? I'm pretty sure the docker docs are written with linux in mind.<@Tony Cioara> has joined the channelSo I usually just use `docker logs container_name` to view stdout and if I need to send a command to the instance then just use `docker exec container_name command`. If you need to bring up the shell for the container that's just `docker exec -it countainer_name /bin/bash`Page above says\n&gt;To stop a container, use CTRL-c, [which] sends SIGKILL to the container. [...]\n&gt; You can detach from a container and leave it running using the CTRL-p CTRL-q key sequence.\n\nUnfortunately, neither `CTRL-p` or `CTRL-q` are detaching for me. :disappointed:\n\nPerhaps this explains why this is such a poorly rated documentation page<https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/attach/><@Jeremy James> set the channel topic: BEW2.2: Docker, DevOps &amp; Containers [ <http://make.sc/bew2.2|make.sc/bew2.2> ] Tracker [ <http://make.sc/trackbew2.2|make.sc/trackbew2.2> ]<http://pollev.com/droxey|pollev.com/droxey>Yea i just created a folder called /data in my home directory or ~ worked fineThe katacoda tutorials said\n&gt;Any data which needs to be saved on the Docker Host, and not inside containers, should be stored in `//opt/docker/data/redis/`\n--&gt; is that the same as `~/opt/docker/data/redis/` ?\n\nSlash is this just a matter of taste? Sounds like it worked for you inside `~/data` ?\n\n```docker run -d \u2014name redisMapped -v /opt/docker/data/redis:/data redis```Just a heads up to those working on docker tutorial!

Spilled water on it. Borrowing the iFixit kit. Hope it's recoverable!bed and z-offset are calibrated/leveledthese are sooo much fun to make! see: iris box\n\n<https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1817180>I\u2019m just gonna leave this here... <https://www.instagram.com/p/BvHsr97hZPU/> please leave a note next time if you were doing something with itthe VR computer had the fans on full blast but wasn't blowing out hot air so I shut it downjust LMK if you want a really high res print of something (ie miniatures, jewelry, etc.)Getting these but they won't be in the makerspace. Resin is a lot more difficult to handle than FDM. Also, <@Duncan MacDonald> I'll bring more glue sticks from home.Any chance anyone has more purple glue sticks they could bring in?i'll try to get an makerspace workshop outline going over spring break and post it here for some async brainstorming :slightly_smiling_face:yup have had other students express the same sentiment to me. My understanding is that unless it's labeled it's up for grabs. We have a free parts/projects bin in the corner as well. As to how you'd get started Dani and I have talked about teaching a session on 3d printing. We'll have to talk about that more.cool :slightly_smiling_face: just thought i'd share that perspective in the context of \"how can we get more students to use the space?\"yup its part of what i am working on and tracking!\nstep 0: establish space\nstep 1: find stuff from old building and put in space\nstep 2: get MS to buy me stuff\nstep 3: teach the people how to build the stuff with the stuff MS buys me :joy:\n\nwe are on step 3I imagine there must be other students that might feel the same =&gt; don't know where to get startedI am super interested in getting more involved with 3D printing, playing with LEDs, Arduinos, etc. but don't know what I'm allowed to touch / where to get started in the Makerspace.ez hardware fix &gt; software fixrofl ya just move the z endstop up or down to compensate for the thickness of the plate.i have the arduino uno chillin over there to flash the firmware but i def didnt do that yetnvm i am remembering improperlyoh waitya is stock?oh did we flash marlin onto the printerspecifically: <https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/a/6660>yeah we can def do that in marlincan't you adjust this in the printer? Z offset?got the glass bed installed but there isn\u2019t enough clearance between the bed with the leveling screws fully tightened and the nozzle, so if you print make sure to manually move the Z axis up a step or twovery cool idea!! keep 'em coming!Project proposals: 1) Design and print more class trophies for all classes. This will involve communication between professors and give students an incentive to win a prize at the end of the term. Case study: BEW, FEW, MOB trophies were printed this term. 2) Teach 1-2 classes on designing, troubleshooting, and 3d printing 3) LED wall panel to display messagesi fixed :smile:Sorry <@Dani Roxberry [BEW]>, just saw this. The bed should be at least decently leveled right now, but I\u2019ve been having trouble getting that _perfect_ leveljk just center perfect level plzafter the test print ends<@Duncan MacDonald> request! can you make sure the bed is crazy, crazy level for me at all major points? corners and centerrequesting the printer for the remainder of the afternoon --- buay on staff side has commissioned prints from me :slightly_smiling_face:going to borrow the calipers for tonight. Will bring back tomorrowgrazieI'll help before lunchyup The bed is super unleveled. Can you show me that trick you had for leveling it later Dani or Duncan?<!channel> is there anything you want on the sd card for the printer? I may have to reformat it because I think I corrupted it by accidentI got a microusb + wall outlet for the Raspberry Pis. Will bring tomorrowyeah it even had a bit of tolerance for the supports to be removed. We'll have to see tomorrow though.The stl comes with built in supports? I\u2019ve never seen that before...hahah funky we'll have to see how well it prints. Like poorly documented code this model did not include printing instructions. My concerns are that the built in supports will be difficult to remove from the print.

If you can make it to the meeting tomorrow, we can discuss our plans for the club moving forwardthat sounds good but lets finish what we started and try to make business model etc for what are we building - which I think also aligns with your proposal <@Jaeson Booker>. I can be our  tentative COO and handle setting deadlines and some logistics. Lets have fun with it. The best way of learning is doing, wouldn\u2019t you agree?Hi, I've been thinking about taking the club's course in a different direction this term. Since most of us were pretty busy last term, it was very difficult to find time to do the work needed for launching an actual startup. I'm thinking this club will instead be a platform to discuss various startup tactics, networking, and support anyone who wishes to launch a startup with the resources they need.

Lets do things step by step. See you guys next timeHey, at Cal Hacks, I spoke with a security researcher working at Avast. He said there is basically no security protocol or universal solution to iOT yet. He also said he felt a personal blockchain could actually solve some of these problems, and said he didn't know of anyone in the field yet who was doing it. Though the path may be difficult to figure out, after speaking with him, I really think this idea has a great amount of potentialsorry guys missed it\u2019<!channel> Club Meeting in Willow Waffle at 12:30!<https://medium.com/mercuryprotocol/how-to-create-your-own-private-ethereum-blockchain-dad6af82fc9f><https://poa.network/><https://altheamesh.com/>might be late but will be there<@Joe Rezendes> has left the channel<!channel> Meeting at 12:30 in Willow Waffle!

I've created a Google Drive for us to store things in. Currently it's pretty empty, but this way we have a place to store it all. For those who don't understand blockchain too well, there's a Resource folder where we can add various articles and tutorials.

(It's one of the rooms in the Great Hall) We'll be going over ideas and a potential MVP to develop. Participation in the idea is completely voluntary, and I encourage anyone who's interested in entrepreneurship to attend!If you're not sure about your commitment, you can say that too. We're just trying to get an idea of how big our group is going to be.:+1: Like this, guys<@Medi Assumani> has left the channelHey everyone, <!channel> We had a great first meeting today. everyone that attended gave us a lot of feedback of what everyone wants to get out of the club. Today I and <@Jaeson Booker> were expecting 25 club members to show up today but only 5 attended. We understand that everyone is very busy, but it would really help us move forward with the club if we all have a good idea of who is committed to attending and who is not.  So I ask everyone who plans on attending to leave a thumbs up if you are committed to attending and a thumbs down if you are not in the comment section.\n\nThanks !!!!!<@Ryan Smith> has left the channelThanks to everyone who came out to our first meeting! I've attached a Google Doc of the ideas and industries proposed. If the idea was your own, feel free to change its description. I also encourage everyone to add any ideas or domains you are interested in tackling, and next meeting we can try to converge on a single one. I'll also attach notes for what we went over at the first meeting, for anyone who missed it. For those who want to be part of the club, but are not interested in building a collaborate product, we'll also be providing entrepreneurship resources, and looking into startup events, mentorship, and networking. <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hNj96iJU9FCBoIXitaPgvTlYVHxwPA3-d3gN2q8KijE/edit?usp=sharing>Blockchain Ideas from Dharma Protocol <https://blog.dharma.io/dharma-ethsf-wishlist-c51daa1228bc>Thanks for the head's up, I'll make sure to update everyone on what we went overHey Jason, \nSorry I couldn\u2019t joined today...something came up and I got caught up...but I will definitely next time.<!channel> Meeting now in Stonehenge Room, Second FloorDon't forget, we'll be meeting at 12:30 today!We will be meeting in the Stonehenge Room on the 2nd Floor, tomorrow at 12:30, hope to see you all there!<@Stephanie Cherubin> has left the channelHey!

Please fill out this quick survey regarding what you hope to get out of this club. Your feedback will help us form what this organization will be about. Thanks to <@Keoni Murray> for his input on the questions. Also, if you haven't responded to the Doodle poll on meeting times, please do so ASAP.  We'll be setting up our first meeting soon! <https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/FNZD6VQ><@Anwar Azeez> has left the channelAnd if there are other times you think would work better to meet, please mention them in the comments.<!channel> Hi everyone, please fill out this quick poll for time(s) that work best for you. If there is a time you can attend, but is not ideal, you can click the option twice to indicate it is not preferred. We will try to get our meetings to suit as many student schedules as possible. We will also be sending out a quick survey regarding what students want to get out of this club. <https://doodle.com/poll/2hv3e4vxbnmd94m2>That sucks :slightly_frowning_face: I'll talk with the staff on Thursday and see when the closing hours are changing at Make School. Maybe they can work something outThat's during unconferences and board games which doesn't work for meHey guys, we're thinking about having our meetings from 4:30-5:30 on Fridays. This seems to be the best time, since it'll be hard to find time on weekdays when all students are free (since the school closes at 6). If this time doesn't work for you, please let us know in the comments, and we can try to find a better time.Hi, this is the beginning of what I hope will be a great group of students passionate about entrepreneurship, new ideas, and innovation. I've been very interested in entrepreneurship for several years, spurring me to pursue an MBA and then cofound a startup and be part of two others. I think Make School is potentially the ideal environment to start something big, since we have a network of different mentors, can take classes that are product-driven, and don't have to be distracted by \"day jobs\". I'm very excited to hear what all of you hope to get out of this club, so that me and <@Keoni Murray> can make this a great organization for everyone here!<@Makhmud Islamov> has joined the channel<@Yves Songolo> has joined the channel<@Carlos Alba> has joined the channel<@Sayema Islam> has joined the channel<@Joe Rezendes> has joined the channel<@Ramon Geronimo> has joined the channel<@Rinni Swift> has joined the channel<@Sarin Swift> has joined the channel<@Jasmine Humbert> has joined the channel<@Anisha Jain> has joined the channel<@Stephanie Cherubin> has joined the channel<@William Hoang> has joined the channel<@Colleen Ni> has joined the channel<@Rushani Shawuti> has joined the channel<@Dylan Finn> has joined the channel<@Connor Cahill> has joined the channel<@KJ Wilson> has joined the channel<@Ryan Smith> has joined the channel<@Jamar Gibbs> has joined the channel<@Ryan Nguyen> has joined the channel<@Medi Assumani> has joined the channel<@Fode Diop> has joined the channel<@Anwar Azeez> has joined the channel<@Keoni Murray> has joined the channel<@Jaeson Booker> set the channel purpose: For those interested in starting tech companies<@Jaeson Booker> has joined the channel"

I can look into if this is something that we can continue to provide given the size of student body thanks for the suggestion!Ok what's the point of having coffee if there is never any sugar or milk/creamer? I haven't seen milk since last November in our fridge... and it's much cheaper than creamer!Sugar and Milk too pleaseI\u2019m OOO but having someone bring some over now!<@Sarah George [Office Manager]> could we have some coffee?

Stay tuned for updates, and I sincerely apologize for this situation!!!I just went outside, I can confirm that it is indeed bad. Anyone know where we can purchase them near campus?Could we have a fair system were anyone could schedule the rooms and the room schedule be available for everyone to see ?Could we please have a system for the private rooms that is available for everyone?

I just thought it would be cool to have a library to collectively gather and read books from. All the books are to stay at Make School and we could develop a small system to check books out as to keep track of who has them.The Make School reputation system shouldn't be like China's, which is built to incentivize basically hive mind dedication to their government. Reputation systems can be designed to actually benefit people, but that's only likely to happen if built BY THE PEOPLE. I'm working on one right now for communities, which would essentially decide how much say you have on a specific issue dependent on how much you've interacted with said issue. Essentially, your reputation is measured as how much you actually know about a specific problem, and that reputation only matters within the context of that problem, meaning that it could be completely different for another problem.China's reputation system is based on unreasonable factors, you use a reputation system everyday to discern whether or not to fight or flee someone you don't know/someone you know/whether or not to believe something someone says, etc.negative the whole concept of a reputation system like china has scares me.yesWe gotta use machine learning on camera feeds with verification on the blockchain obviously :face_with_rolling_eyes:The honor systemWe could just make a rule about not using the books off campuswe need a reputation system <@Anisha Jain> has left the channel<@Asim Zaidi> has left the channelno =(We had this before and people went skrt skrt with the books!A community library where we can drop off technical books, and textbooks for others to read basically a shelf labeled librarydo any of the storage closets have compressed air by any chance?The cleaning company we use said they would bring replacements!<@Sarah George [Office Manager]> thank you :pray::skin-tone-5: OhhhhhhhhThanks!

Does anyone know what time will it be open? I have an interview at 9 am and I was hoping that I could get into the school and use a conference room for the interview<!channel> Hi staff, two days ago all the students received an email from operation stating that the building would be open from 8-8pm during weekdays. This morning I got to Make School at 8 am to prepare before my interview and the school was closed. Could we get everyone on board about the school hours? Or give the keys to the Openers and Closers to open them building?And sanitizer :slightly_smiling_face: Though I\u2019ve seen it elsewhereTissue Paper in the classrooms possibly, since it is that time of year.Let's order some curtains for the small windows in the upstairs classroom next to the Great Hall please - it'll help a ton.Hand soap<@Erik Perez> has left the channel<@Sarah George [Office Manager]>The pipe in Macchu Picchu is leaking again<@Brisaida Trujillo> has left the channel<@Jayce Azua> has left the channelIt ain't chilly unless your skin starts chapping-off from mere exposure*chilly*It ain't cold unless you can see your breath trail.

It\u2019s kind of chilly upstairs :snowflake:<@Phyllis Wong> I'll talk to megan and caroline, i'd hate to think there's someone taking peoples food cause the cleaners only throw out on the weekendI think there might be more to this. Another student mentioned to me today that they put something labeled in the fridge just yesterday, and it was gone today. Additionally, there is a ton of unlabeled food in the freezer that is clearly not getting emptied. And it is not labeled. Can we re-norm about this as a community at the next all hands?Hello <@Phyllis Wong>! So, because, as you can imagine, with over 100 people using the fridge it's important to keep it clean (it's very easy to forget food) the cleaners were under instruction to clean/sanitize the fridge every Friday and throw away any food left in the fridge every Saturday (except what is in tupperware)\nPerhaps when you leave food in the fridge over the weekend, label it DO NOT THROW AWAY and then the date of the upcoming Monday so they know it should be kept until then?I was told by the organizers of the event that they didn't throw anything away, it's possible it was put in the corner thoughThank you <@Sarah George [Office Manager]> :slightly_smiling_face:<@Phyllis Wong> I am checking in to see if cleaners or anyone regularly goes through the fridge and if it is them I'll let them know not to throw away marked items, but I'm afraid it might have been organizers just in a hurry to clear space or something =/ I can maybe make a sign for the fridge stating to not throw away or take marked items if there isn't one already?Can we get some clarity about food in the fridge please? I left a full meal from Halal Guys in a bag, taped closed, with my name on it in the fridge to eat today. This morning it was gone from the fridge, while there were other meals clearly left over the weekend. Another time a month or so ago I left something labeled and in the freezer to eat on Monday, and it was gone by Monday morning. :disappointed:<@Erik Batista> has left the channelWe need punching bags in there I thought we were SOLVING problems not contributing to themYou are not in sf if there isn\u2019t a crazy screaming in the streets:skull:^just go outside and do it, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s that abnormal hereA room for frustrated screamingIm still pretty sweetBYE<https://open.spotify.com/album/3tx8gQqWbGwqIGZHqDNrGe?si=ewd3RNo2TaKMVvC4XsfWCA>I think we\u2019ve run out of sugar...Hello everyone! there is a blue bowl of apple cider vinegar and dish soap on the counter in the kitchen area, hoping it will attract the fruit flies just FYI<@Sam Galizia> has left the channelIce??More blue tape and sharpie for the kitchen please.We need something to get rid of these gnatsjust posted in the general <@Wenzel Lowe> open until 6What time does Make School close today again?jk<@Kandy McGhee>  <@Jaeson Booker> We already have oneInstead of a ball pit can we have a snake pit??And a snake pit.so cute :sob:OMG PLEASE...and kitties :smiley_cat:yes can we can a de-stress room with lots of cute puppiesI can bring my dog <@Sarah George [Office Manager]>\nI think a pretty good amount of us could use HDMI to usb coffice anxiety-relieving dogsCan we have more dish wash soap in the kitchen?:dancing_penguin:awesome, thank you <@Dylan Finn>I have some fruit fly traps I will place in there, let's see if it worksI think most people need hmdi-usb or male-to-male hmdi cordsjust to make sure i get the right ones <@Dylan Finn> would it be hdmi to lightning that most people would need?Was literally about to say we\u2019re out of em upstairsHey can we get more HDMI cords in the monitor room?It seems all the slippers from the upstairs men\u2019s bathroom have moved to the downstairs bathroom where there are a ton of themI noticed the fruit flys are coming back in the kitchen.

Bc the tutorial does not instruct you how to do it. BUT! You must paginate your search results!!!! :DHeads up <!channel> by end of week please put your blog post topic in the tracker and turn in at least the first \u201crecipe\u201d you\u2019ve shipped to a real project in the wild.FYI `let onlineUsers = {}` needs to be declared at the top of app.js and outside of the `io.on('connection, [...])` function.\n\nOtherwise, onlineUsers will not persist. So if you refresh, onlineUsers will be blank.\n\nBefore:\n\n```\n// app.js\n\nconst io = require('<http://socket.io|socket.io>')(server);\nlet onlineUsers = {};\nio.on(\"connection\", (socket) =&gt; {\n  require('./sockets/chat.js')(io, socket, onlineUsers);\n})\n```\nAfter:\n\n```\n// app.js\n\nlet onlineUsers = {};\n\n// <http://Socket.io|Socket.io>\nlet io = require('<http://socket.io|socket.io>').listen(server);\nio.on('connection', (socket) =&gt; {\n  require('./sockets/chat.js')(io, socket, onlineUsers);\n});\n```\n\nSubmitted a GH issue for this (<https://github.com/MakeSchool-Tutorials/Make-Chat-Tutorial/issues/8>) but posting here for anybody who already got past that step inn the tutorialHey there, let\u2019s go on a field trip tomorrow evening :smile: <https://www.eventbrite.com/e/state-of-javascript-presented-by-hack-reactor-galvanize-tickets-55547966463>Using the bin/www is greater separation of concerns, since defining your app and initializing middleware is a different concern than turning the thing on. <@Ali Shalabi> has joined the channelIt's more of preference. however, when using React, Angular, etc its more conventional to use `bin/www` for production and development phases of your projectBeen reading in to this and still a bit confused, moving forward when setting up Node/Express apps - should we a use a bin/www or is it cool to to just define my port in app.js/server.js?If you want feedback or a code review on a project, just slack me it and I will provide. I\u2019m also happy to do pair programming with anyone and we can work on something you or I am working on and learn together. Just slack me and book my calendar.<@Asim Zaidi>Tutorials I only check for completion b/c everyone\u2019s are the same, so there isn\u2019t much feedback<@Adam Braus> not sure if you covered this / but how can we expect to receive feedback on our tutorials/when? Thanks!<@Asim Zaidi> - we miss youHey <@Adam Braus>, im going to go home early cause I'm starting to get sick. ok great I\u2019ll double checkSame, and since we\u2019re using the full text search i think we\u2019d have to have 4 dogs with the same name for it to work.To clarify, earlier I ran `npm i -D node-mongo-seeds` to install as a dev dependency and added `\"seed\": \"seed\"` to scripts in my package.json. Be sure to run the command in one line and it should work!I modified seed.js to:\n```process.env.NODE_ENV = process.env.NODE_ENV || 'dev';\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  dev: 'localhost/petes-pets',\n  prod: process.env.MONGODB_URI,\n};```\nthen ran `MONGODB_URI=[value from Heroku] NODE_ENV=prod npm run seed`So I implemented it the way the tutorial said to but you are saying it isn\u2019t working on my site so I\u2019m wondering is there a different result you are expecting? Because I am able to search without any issues. Also I believe you\u2019re going to need to provision a db user that has write access in order for you to make any remote connection to the databaseif you go on to the mongolabs dashboard through heroku, you should be provided with a hostname and other information needed to connect to your db  (and seed it). You could also use `mongodump` to export a collection from your petes pets database as a `bson` file and then use `mongostore` on that bson file to import it into your database remotely.locallyyou just direct the seed file to populate your remote dbI think Wenzel\u2019s way is righthere's what i tried but this doesn't workrunning locally only creates DB items locally, though? How do you seed the production database?How I did it was run seed from my local machine in the same folder, but change the seed.js with my mlab instance (with process.env)Hey <@Adam Braus> is there an easy way to run `seed` on heroku?Thx!Also I can\u2019t assess that your production is working (and neither can you!) unless there are some pets up there. So please add some pets and double check that your code is working.It looks like many many people do not have pagination working in the search pages of their PPPE. Please complete this. It is a bit challenging but the steps and code are there. I know you are all capable of itIn class today we\u2019ll cover the last few patterns in PPPE and then finally look at async/await and then refactor some PPPE (or other project you have) to use async await.<@Adam Braus> set the channel topic: <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uU1wqterFOZE4GIrYHjHJ9jEQD7lSIPkXw88UBFj9eo/edit#gid=0><!channel> please have PPPE turned in today before class startsBut so long as you only have 1 API with no versions, this works great.If your project has bigger teams, and versioned api\u2019s then it won\u2019t work.Na dawg less visibility Bro can you start using the thread feature :sweat_smile:<@Edwin Cloud> awesome yeah this'll be great moving forward on small projects then!Though, I haven't implemented a fix yetyes I did. I think the way to fix it is to fetch the image on the when loading the EDIT route, similarly to the same way we fetch an image for the SHOW routeOnly downside I can think of is code organization. For the purpose of separating concerns, I usually make a separate api controller with all the `/api` routes.. or if you are doing it for each controller, you could make another controller for each controller and just append `_api` to the name. For example: `books_api.js`Seems kind of cool, build out a monolithic app and an API at once!Anyone know if there are any downsides of the method where we just detect if the `Content-Type` of the request is `application/json` and then return JSON, otherwise return the HTML template?Did you run into the issue where you have to upload a avatar everytime you edit it? For some reason if i don\u2019t redo it It\u2019s just gone?:smile: awesome!lolshut up and take my claps!Dude, I got mine to heroku in one try with this guide\u2026. :heart: :two_hearts:LolI keep going back to the Rotten Potatoes tutorial to find the commands you need to push to Heroku, but it's a bit hard to find from Google, so I wrote a handy cheatsheet.

Truly, we cannot even begin to comprehend the nature of cannabis, as we do not even have a baseline definition of what Cannabis is. And yet, many of us are consumers.\n\nWe know that after K-12, we're supposed to go slog through four years of hell to get a degree, just as we know Cannabis makes people lazy.\n\n<#CJ0QBPAAH|cannabis> is an opportunity to develop your own, informed opinion on Cannabis, while cultivating relationships with buds along the way.\n\n---\n\nMy interest in Cannabis grew because of the potential to make $$$ - in more ways than one.\n\nLater, I started consuming, and through this, was birthed into reality. I never gave much thought to the heat of the sun, or the enchaining capabilities of salt, but I became aware through Cannabis. Through the simple enhancement of my senses I was more interconnected with reality, something I had struggled with in the past. I was always in my head, thinking. Marijuana helped me appreciate the true meaning of being a human, having a body, and being able to experience life at it is.\n\nThis is just the tip of the ice-burg for me, but before this post gets too long I want say thanks for joining and hope we can burn togetherIn this thread, we share why we joined <#CJ0QBPAAH|cannabis>/are interested in CannabisAs you may be aware, April 20th is quite a important day for Cannabis, but are you familiar with the fantastical origins of 4/20? \n\n&gt; In 1971, five high school students \u2013 Steve Capper, Dave Reddix, Jeffrey Noel, Larry Schwartz, and Mark Gravich - in San Rafael, California, calling themselves the Waldos because \"their chosen hang-out spot was a wall outside the school\", used the term in connection with a 1971 plan to search for an abandoned cannabis crop that they had learned about, based on a treasure map made by the grower. \n\n&gt; The Waldos designated the Louis Pasteur statue on the grounds of San Rafael High School as their meeting place, and 4:20 p.m. as their meeting time. The Waldos referred to this plan with the phrase \"4:20 Louis\". \n\n&gt; After several failed attempts to find the crop, the group eventually shortened their phrase to simply \"4:20\", which ultimately evolved into a code-word that the teens used to mean consuming cannabis.<@Aakash (Kash) Sudhakar> has joined the channel<@Rohan Mishra> set the channel purpose: Cannabis is a multi-billion dollar tech sector on :fire:.

Then it became a currency just catering to large banks and financial institutions. McCaleb left Ripple, and created Stellar, which aims to be what Ripple was meant to be.The backbone of crypto is not to trust, but look for proof<https://prestonbyrne.com/2018/09/20/for-the-last-time-ripple-created-xrp/>What's the word on the street about ripple being bad?<@Jaeson Booker> I think other currencies are capable of debasing the banking system long term, but JPM coin has potential to snuff out Ripple sooner rather than later. I see what you're saying about them being worse, but I guess it depends on what you consider. At least the banking system serves some sort of purpose, Ripple is just a senseless duplication of our current banking system with middlemen making money...Wouldn't this be worse than Ripple?

However, the issue is that the technology is energy intensive which holds potencial to significantly add to climate change if it is used improperly. I was wondering if people here would be interested in having brain storming meeting to discuss these potentials and figure out if it possible to get the positive impacts of the technology without the negative.

Gauged interest/experience of members (s/o <@Jaeson Booker> for sharing his opinions on the crypto space)\n&gt; 2. Created a Drive to organize the club (s/o to <@Makhmud Islamov> :fist: for getting us off the ground with a Drive)\n&gt; 3.

Guided Discussion - random hot topics/white papers/etc, lead by whomever wants to do so.\n\nThe topics for both groups are decided at the end of the session. Any person is invited to lead a Guided Discussion or Workshop.It's happening...\n&gt; On *Tuesday, November 6th* at *1:00 PM* we'll have a 20-minute meeting *in the Main Lobby,* plotting the course/gauging interest for *The Blockchain Club* this year.\n\nEvent to add to your Calendar - <https://calendar.google.com/calendar/b/1/r/eventedit?text=Blockchain+Club+First+Meeting&amp;dates=20181106T210000Z/20181206T212000Z&amp;details=First+meeting+to+plot+course,+more+details+in+blockchain+channel+Slack&amp;location=Main+Lobby>\n\n*Bring your lunch* and get ready for a pow-wow style session where we discuss how the club should function (topics to cover, things to do, meeting processions, anything you want).

Not to mention Q and As with some really interesting people.welcome <@Daniel Sullivan><@Daniel Sullivan> has joined the channelI second that <@Fode Diop>. I got a lot of work to do and this whole conversation is unnecessary.I would elaborate, but we unfortunately have MakeSchool work to do. Let\u2019s catch up in person and sort this out.With all due respect I actually disagree <@Rohan Mishra> That was most certainly a personal attack. For one you seem to be confusing Blockchains and Applications of BlockchainsAlthough I appreciate your \u201cconcerns\u201d on my behalf, I tend to find this argument not necessary, because we both now that your \u201cconcerns\u201d on my behalf has nothing to do with my well being. I would do my research personally on the company instead of believing on some random thread. Cashbet made 38 million dollars by selling the ICO to a investor and not to the public, yes I do agree their is a lot of \u201cscams\u201d on the crypto space, but that\u2019s only due to the lack of knowledge on the technology and on cryptocurrencies. Winview which is the company which bought the ICO along with other investors are the ones responsible to the sells/trade of the currency\u2026 and my involvement as a professional was to guarantee the functionality of one of the many project and platforms they have, in the end of the day I did what I was paid to do, what it\u2019s done with it it\u2019s not my resposabilitywelcome <@Tia (TJ) King> Because when I pointed out that it was a scam <@Briant (Elliot) Oliveira> said \"they still raised 38 million dollars\" which reflects the kind of old school thinking that created the centralized systems where people take advantage of others who have lesser knowledge than themselves. This sort of thinking is precisely not the point of crypto, especially the \"Open Finance\" ideology that Ethereum is trying to pursure (which the Cashbet platform claims to have be building on) and has shifted to. Its also important that people be aware of scams so that they're not taken advantage of.  \"I did not worked on their ICO,\" doesn't mean anything. If you helped them test their smart contracts you are complicit in helping them scam people, because even now they're not hitting their roadmap goals, and even now they don't have the ability to build the tech they promised. Theses are not attacks on either of you as people - I've enjoyed our brief conversations <@Fode Diop> and I respect you, but if you yourself cannot separate Cashbet from your own identity, and view it as an attack on yourself, you fundamentally understand why I think writing code for scams like this make people just as responsible. With some basic due diligence (I literally Googled and read the whitepaper, looked at the team and realized that the tech they're trying to build is leagues most people's capabilities in the general blockchain space, let alone the Cashbet team) one could have easily discovered that Cashbet was abusing the cryptocurrency buzzword to rip off people. Cashbet was promising an incredible piece of technology without any sort of fundamental idea as to how it would be possible to execute it. This is Theranos on a different scale.\n\nEssentially, I'm worried about things greater than you or me. I don't want this kind of thinking to leak to other people, and I don't want <@Briant (Elliot) Oliveira> to be hurt any further by this kind of thinking.<@Tia (TJ) King> has joined the channelI second that.

I had a tough time finding the best practices online for some reason, basically I realized I have certain views in which I don\u2019t want to pass the entire model down because it\u2019s excess information so I heard view models are the way to like instantiate part of a model to be sent down to a view.. would love to hear if anyone has done this yet?That\u2019s cool, I\u2019d love to check out the projects if you have em up on GitHub?The hashtable structure (dict) is useful for searching through values and keys.I'm also using a stack to help reference older dicts for useI'm using dictionaries, sets and tuples , multiple sorting algorithms, and compression algorithms for a project I am currently working onWould love to hear if/how anyone is combining cool CS topics with a backend project? Right now the only data structure I think I\u2019ve used is an array when storing a list of items in my model, and then using built in Node methods to access and edit it. Not sure where/how I could for instance use a hash map or linked list in my project?yeah, just kidding.<@Stephanie Cherubin> I don't think it is built on JSlol, yes Carlos.

Thats good if that is what you're going for. Otherwise maybe highlight some of the engineering and development skills that you used in each app (e.g. agile development, team-based development, REST, security features etc.)\n\nEducation part looks good. Overall its pretty good looking.  :heart:Hey, guys. I copied <@Jayce Azua>\u2019s general format (with his permission). Could I get some feedback on it?<@Jayce Azua> has left the channeli'd advise having <@Megan Dias> or <@Caroline Virani [StuEx]> help you more on this(Megan helped me with mine)<@Medi Assumani> Thank you!! I didn\u2019t include the project I did in the Google program since that was my first time building a website and shit was ugly af:joy: you\u2019re right tho, it looks kinda dry only stating I attended the program\u20261. From what i've seen around and personal perspective, I don't think your full  address on your resume, \"San Francisco,CA\" is good enough as it entails your current location. 2. If the resume is printed out or read on a pdf reader that does not support links(unlikely but might happen), the reviewer might have a hard time to view your linked-in, Github, or portfolio.  3. For your high lights, each bullets could consisely describes what you accomplished or did instead of facts like 2% acceptance rate(personal oppinon) but the \"10K follower\" bullet point is strong since you are putting real numbers. 4. Maybe group your languages and tools together on the same page. 5. For your engineering experience, tell more about your accomplishment during this program(2-3 bullet points) . 6. On your volunteered experience section, you used the verb \"helped\" twice in one sentence, maybe change that to remove redundancy.  7. Lastly for education, Im more biased to put MS instead of DU but that's totally up to you. Besides that, I think the order is good and it flows really well. Just look out for little grammatical errors and you should be ok from my point of view. <@Rushani Shawuti>Just finished editing my resume, would appreciate any feedback!Still missing some clients that i made their website forThis message was deleted.<@Jayce Azua> has joined the channelI think in more cases, GPA is for screening purposes, and less transcript requests<@Jen Sikora [Academic Compliance]> has joined the channel<@Jen Sikora [Academic Compliance]>: Any input to add here?but then gpa doesnt appear on the transcript:slightly_frowning_face:Thank You very much <@Faith Chikwekwe>```GPA === NaN```I think the correct answer is:\n`GPA = None` :python::smile:\nor `nil` :swift::simple_smile:\nor `null` :java::neutral_face:\nor possibly `undefined`? :javascript::sob:<@Medi Assumani> Make sure that when you send out your resume its only one page long. Even though the content  is one page long, its renders as two pages. In the bottom section (TeenTechSF) there is an extra space in the description sentence.\n\nI would go further than <@Matthew Harrilal> and say to put your software projects first, tech skills next and education after that. Most people looking at Make School resumes like us because we can code and ship products.That's exactly what I've been doingSomeone who looked over my resume mentioned to put a GPA of 4.0 on a 4.0 scale, because education without a GPA may seem shady, and we are pass/fail (so far, no failed classes)... Thoughts on this?And I love the spacing, things arent too crowded so my eyes can flow through it easily. I'd suggest your to show it to Megan as well and she will give you some great insights.<@Matthew Harrilal> Looks great, you may want to update the education section and maybe mention that you're getting a BS in Applied CS if you'd like.<@Matthew Harrilal> Thank You<@Anna Pawl> appreciate it!You\u2019re using a lot of different techniques to highlight the same info. Is this because they're links on a digital resume? Consider choosing between bold, blue, or an underline, instead of all three.Hey ya'll, I would appreciate some feedback on my resume! Drop those concerns, comments, refactoring solutions whatever it may be!Really like it though!I really like the spacing between elements <@Medi Assumani> makes it easy to add and remove components without having to worry about the resume structure. I would say your technical skills are more relevant than your education so I would put that first.Hey Guys, I just updated my resume and would love some feedbacks if you can, thank you!Thank you <@Stephanie Cherubin> !! I will add those as well! :grinning:I would also so to add links to your projects (if they are good and live) or even a link to the Github repos corresponding to the projects.Thank you <@Brian Nguyen [TA]> and <@Medi Assumani> for the feedback! Making improvements now!:grinning:And you could use action verbs like \"designed\", \"coded\", \"launched\" for each project. But yeah i love the simplicity of it that easily helps me flow through it.something like that if you'd liketo back help you make your contact info less condense, you could put hyper links on them<@Marianna Campbell> ^^- I\u2019m not a fan of the way contact info is currently formatted, too much text condensed into one small section\n- Skills: you can dive a bit deeper and include a few more popular frameworks (e.g. Flask, Handlebars.js)\n- Projects: be consistent with formatting, some projects have a dash after project name and others do not. Move your roles in the projects into the project header. Use consistent tense in your bullet points, currently I see both present and past tenses. It would be great if you can elaborate on one or two main aspects of the project that you worked on.\n- Volunteer &amp; Leadership: if an experience starts and ends in the same month, you don\u2019t have to use the Start - End format, just say May 2018. I would prefer the format to be consistent across both sections, aka italicize Adv Council Pres, \u201cDetroit, MI\u201d should be either both aligned right or both aligned left.\n- Overall: I really like the overall layout, super clean and easy to glance through! If you play around with the margin and spacing, all of the content can be included in just one page. Currently the bullet points are just describing your responsibilities, it would be nice if you can add in some bits about the impact you made.I would greatly appreciate any/all feedback.<@Dani Roxberry [BEW]> has joined the channelThanks Brian! Using these suggestions now- Contact info: I usually prefer consistent formatting, so perhaps have email and phone number on separate lines like your Github and website\n- Your name in the header seems to be lower than contact info on the right, probably due to the extra space formatted on top of your name.\n- For projects: I would include in the project header your specific role in the project (frontend dev, backend dev, full stack dev, etc.), it\u2019s more noticeable when recruiters glance through. Alternate your action verbs to start bullet points.\n- Tend/Prof.link projects: I think the \u201c# site hits with # total users\u201d loses significance in the faded text, probably better to be included among the bullets\n- Education: Bachelor in Applied Computer Science<@Ryan Nguyen> has joined the channel<@Asim Zaidi> has joined the channelI'd love to have some feedback on this resume.

So you may want to have a vertical one too if you want to send it into a larger company.

You can reply here or private message. I would like to hear comments on structure, design, grammar, and anything in between. Thank you so much!Note: Your resume should not be more than *one page* (unless you already have 5 or more years of significant experience).Here\u2019s my resume for your reference. You can see every bullet point starts with an action verb that describes what I *did*, and each role has a variety of words (you can use this as a thesaurus). Including numbers also increases your credibility.Feedback me up! :heart:<@Michael Loubier> I like how you are planning on doing a custom summary for each company :fire: One confusion when looking at yours is under skills \u201cWhat do these bars mean?\u201d  Full bar = Wizard?  Full bar = proficient ?  might just be me, but bars confused me :upside_down_face: Otherwise, I like how you used different font weights to show emphasis and filling the whole page looks great!  One last thought:  LOVE the fact you included hobbies and interests :fire:<@Kenny Batista> We just chatted about yours :slightly_smiling_face:Bring on the feedback! \n\nThank you!Totally digging this peer review channel :eyes:If I could get your feedback I'd greatly appreciate it!I'm aware that Make School wasn't explained in the resume. I can't assume that people will know what Make School is. Any suggestions on where and what to include as a description for Make School?Version 1.0 of my updated resume. I'd like feedback. Thanks !Thanks for the feedback!! I'll edit my resume today :slightly_smiling_face: :heart:<@Julia Geist>: Great work experiences. I think if you have the links for the projects that would make the projects stronger too. And like what we did during core session, if you can start project descriptions with a verb like Built with unity and then go on explaining more about what the project does may be helpful to catch the attention of the person reading your resume. Overall, very strong with the work experience and volunteer work. Also maybe export your pdf in a higher res - 2x or 3x because right now on the web it can get pixilated :cold_sweat:\n\nOverall, very strong, visually appeasing, and it showcases your awesome work really well!Nice Work Julia!  One thing that stood out for me was education timeline for Make School - May 2016 - August 2016? Maybe update to be start date to graduation date?<http://Juliageist.com/resume|Juliageist.com/resume>:thumbsup:Correct. I\u2019ve been told to remove references from my resume in the past.

This is a huge, pretty kickass project involving everything from data processing and image analysis to neural nets and object detection. Anyone who wants to be a part of this is free to join and compete with us! \n\nThe problem this year: we are tasked with taking microscopic image data of biological cells and create, train, and test a model that is capable of recognizing and manipulating new cell images in order to detect their nuclei in an attempt to improve standardized med.tech for drug testing and treatments. The rewards are great: top five competing teams can win cash prizes starting at $5,000, with the top team earning $50,000 and a cutting-edge NVIDIA AI supercomputing system (~$70k value)!  And of course, this is a phenomenal way to get a stellar data science project on your portfolio! \n\nIf you\u2019re interested, come thru tomorrow at 4pm right after the DS1 class (downstairs); <@Mike Kane [DS]>, <@Kaichi Momose> and I will be leading the discussion on how to get started with this competition! :tada:<https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870>meet the best weapon for the job: a Mask R-CNNSneak peak at what DS Club will be doing this term: <https://youtu.be/Dbiq6l50zO8>Sure:)\nI can visit your place around 6:00 cuz Egon and I will cook soup!<@Kaichi Momose>: If we meet today, can we look over this article and discuss plans for the project? <http://flip.it/wj3xPd><@Aakash (Kash) Sudhakar>  and <@Kaichi Momose>, following up on our conversations about region proposal networks and object detection, this blog does a great job of introducing the topic and explaining how it all works.

I would definitely take a look at luminoth and see if you can make use of it when working on the data science bowl challenge Follow up to link above \u2014 <@Kaichi Momose> and I formed a Kaggle team and are gonna work over these next few months to try and derive some insights out of the DSB2018 dataset.

But we\u2019re committed to see it done! \n\nFollow our repo here: <https://github.com/AakashSudhakar/2018-data-science-bowl>Hey guys! I found a super cool project that we could try on Kaggle as part of the Data Science Bowl 2018! This looks like a really cool opportunity to work from start to finish on a challenging data science problem, from aggregating the data to analyzing and visualizing it! Here\u2019s the link for more details: <https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2018>Great video, <@Aakash (Kash) Sudhakar>!  Thanks for sharing.  Building an SVM from scratch is hard, period.  To most data scientists, \u201cbuilding an SVM\u201d only means `from sklearn import SVM`.  Kudos for going really going the extra mile on this one!S\u2019up folks, merry Christmas and happy holidays for everyone and I\u2019m really excited to see you all in a matter of a few more weeks! Just wanted to throw another resource here for ya. \n\nOver the past few weeks, I\u2019ve been busy working on machine learning algorithms and found that it\u2019s not required, but REALLY helpful to understand some of the mathematical equations and relationships that some of these more advanced algorithms demand. \n\nFor example, I just built a challenging algorithm (at least challenging to me) called a Support Vector Machine, which is a probability-based decision machine (makes a binary decision) to classify data in a relatively memory-efficient manner. The code is simple to copy, but pretty difficult to understand exactly how and why it works. One really helpful lecture I found on it is an MIT OpenCourseWare video lecture on SVMs (<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PwhiWxHK8o>), which really helped me understand how it works but it requires some math understanding. \n\nI really encourage going through the MIT OCW vids on Youtube, as they\u2019re really nice for explaining complex algorithms and the math behind them in detail. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll help with the CS and DS curricula moving forward, to say the least!<@Yves Songolo> has joined the channelAwesome article shared by <@Rohan Mishra> about some of the advanced mathematics behind deep learning.

I\u2019d encourage you all to still meet and take a look at some cool stuff on Kaggle, or work through some of the awesome resources that are starting to accumulate in this channel! \n\nApologies again for missing the meeting.

Same time, same room! :fire:Hey gang--hope you all enjoyed your holiday.  Stumbled on this white paper, and it was too cool not to share.  This is from a recent paper on a type of Neural Network called a StarGAN, a type of Generative Adversarial Network (happy to talk your ear off about GANs if you ever have a free minute).\n\nIn this picture, we can see examples of inputs and outputs from a trained StarGAN.  This GAN has learned how to take a face and passably modify the image to change the hair color, gender, age, paleness, etc of the person in the input image.  I think the examples on the right are even cooler, because it means that the GAN has learned feature mappings of the human face that have to do with expressing emotion.  We can see from the examples that the GAN can modify facial expressions to make the person seem angry, happy, fearful, etc.  This is really exciting stuff, and the speed at which researchers are improving GANs is pretty staggering--they were only invented in 2014 (by Ian Goodfellow, after a discussion/argument in a bar with friends).  Suuuuuuuper cool stuff, especially if you're interested in Machine Learning.<@Alan Davis [CS]> has joined the channel<https://tomassetti.me/guide-natural-language-processing/><!channel> where\u2019s everyone at? <@Melody Yang> has joined the channel*cough* every tuesday at 6 *cough*Why do you always do it the day I stay home lol<@Johnathan Chen> Yessir!

In particular, it\u2019s most important to attempt the `append`, `prepend`, and `length` method implementations, as we\u2019ll be reviewing those first during Level Up office hours next Tuesday at 12pm.\n\nLinked Lists are also an ingredient necessary to understand and implement Hash Tables, which is the next major topic we\u2019ll learn during Tuesday\u2019s CS 1.2 class at 3:30pm, so *making effective use of this weekend* to focus on the Linked List challenges will *set you up for success* next week.\n\nYou should *pair program and study with classmates* to review material presented in class using the resources in the course repo.

            "text": "Thanks for asking, Dacio. Thanks for answering, Shane. I am hoping all groups arrive to class on Friday with a draft that you like while also feeling prepared to go deeper with it, revise and improve in response to peer workshops. Looking forward :slightly_smiling_face:<@Dacio Romero> I do remember 5 pages/1500 words<@Marianne Rogoff [Writing]> Did you say it was 5 pages for the group story? I need to figure out how much we need to work so I can balance my work.Here is some inspiration from last time we met :slightly_smiling_face:Good morning! This is a reminder that there is NO CLASS for Creative Writing today, Friday April 26, as I will be in all-day training at Dominican. (Would much prefer to be with you all.) Please see above note from last week regarding assignment. As always, just ask if you have any questions. Dr. RHello,\nI hope you are enjoying the break from our Friday routine and taking advantage of Spring weather and nature in bloom whenever you can get away from your desk.\n\nI am writing to keep you posted about the final Creative Writing assignment. Last week, we formed groups to write a collaborative \"world-building\" fiction. Each group seemed more interested in the future than the past or present so I let go of my original plan, which is fine.\n\nGroups:\nSal/Tony/Dacio\nFode/Betsy/Sukhrob\nKhalil/Shane/Nya/Henry\n\nAs a component of this assignment we looked at images of the \"Hero's Journey\" formula for story writing aka \"narrative arc\" as a way to structure your story (Google it).\n\nEach story will include:\nsetting (place, which can be imaginary or actual, and time: how far into the future?)\ncharacters (protagonists / antagonists) situation (what do the characters want? what are the obstacles? do they get it in the end?)\n\nThere is a research component to the assignment, as even fiction is based in the facts of reality to give the reader a ground to stand on. Each group member should be prepared to cite one reference to support your understanding of how future emerges from history, why characters behave the way they do, conflict resolution techniques, more details on Hero's Journey archetypes, or a reading on the craft of story writing.\n\nThere is no class next week on April 26, as I will be at a required all-day training. Please use free time between now and when we meet again on Friday May 3 to do research and meet with your group to move the story forward.\n\nWe'll have a workshop in class on May 3 to help push the draft to next level. I\u2019ll also ask each person to give a short talk on your research findings.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.\n\nDr. RGoing to be late to class had a doctors appointment .Hello and Happy Spring Break to all, while I teach this week at another school that does not break until last week of March. Thank you for your notes and messages. I have filled out the official Make School Attendance Worksheet, which includes notice for those \"at risk\" of failing the course at this midterm moment. If you believe you might be one of those people, please plan to come to class next week, Friday March 22, with print copies of all assignments due to date, per syllabus and above instructions. Also, please read Chapter 4 in GameLife (and Chapter 3 if you are liking the book).

Please come ready to discuss GraphQL, sprint progress, and other normal meeting stuff. \n\nJust a reminder, the meeting is scheduled for 11:30 am in Tea Tree Torte on Tuesday the 12th (tomorrow). \n\nSpecial thanks to <@Medi Assumani> for being willing to lead the meeting, I\u2019ll reconnect after to check how it goes. You only need to access our API, so you can verify a user is enrolled at Make School, right? Sounds to me you\u2019re already coupling this app closely then. Maybe you could organise the app in a way, so that you have different auth folders and Make School is one of them. Then when you start adopting other schools, they would get their own folder and their own way to login users &amp; query their data to display on the app. That way you would keep all requests organised in a single place. Also if you think about it, it\u2019s highly unlikely that the REST calls from another school will mirror ours?A suggestion/concern on the new MS API (graphQL):\n\nFrontend teams should not be making requests to MS APIs. The backend will be providing endpoints for the clients thus keeping the clients dependent of our API and not MS.\n\nI mention this bc of our \"rocket ship\" idea <@Duncan MacDonald> described in the past; to add our app to other school systemsNo Problem.Thanks for taking notes!Today's meeting Note: <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pi2VMLBWKiE78KL5txnWv3cSXLmm2DgA1THNseX3Ezk/edit?usp=sharing>GraphQL resource: <https://graphql.org/learn/>\n<https://www.makeschool.com/graphiql>Really Cool, let me know if you\u2019d like to discuss strategy or ways to increase the likelihood of adoption.

You can access our API explorer now.

Yea I think it would be a great idea to talk to instructors too and see if they have any feedback, they could help with adoption too Another thing, we should have a meeting with Alena, Dion, or other Make School staff to see where we can go with this app -- features that make sense to include.  <@Duncan MacDonald> <@Yves Songolo> <@Jake Tran> <@Willie Johnson> <@Matthew Harrilal> <@Erick Sanchez> Hey y'all, happy 2019 :tada: Anyone have new plans for this project or are we all still on board finishing this up this term?\n\n<@Duncan MacDonald> <@Uchenna Aguocha> <@Yves Songolo> <@Jake Tran> <@Willie Johnson> <@Matthew Harrilal>Gotcha.

Don\u2019t wait too long with this though because the instructors might be able to give you some valuable feedback that you can then incorporate into the polished product.We haven\u2019t demoed the app to any instructors yet, but that\u2019s something that we\u2019re definitely going to be doing once we have a more polished platformThat\u2019s great! Thanks Duncan. Have you also reached out to other stakeholders like Anne &amp; various instructors who will be replacing their attendance routine with your app? They might have some more insights on what it would take to get the app adopted.We\u2019re in the user testing phase right now, but our next steps are to get iOS onto the App Store and android into user testing. Once we ramp up user testing, we\u2019ll have a lot more students ready to try out the app and give us feedback. Hey you all! Awesome presentation, thank you so much for making sure I could be there.

We were thinking about doing an android version when we started but neither of us knew android dev well enough, so I would definitely encourage you to take a stab at it if you get the chance Also looking to get back into some Android dev so may spin up an Android version a little later this yearAnd would like to move this and other tools like it to a organization so it's easier to get more students involvedI'll be joining the engineering team as a PM in mid-SeptemberDo you have any future plans to add more features? Are both of you coming back as seniors? <@Duncan MacDonald> <@Matthew Harrilal>Just added you as a contributor <@Dion Larson [MS PM]>Thanks!`dionlarson`Hey <@Dion Larson [MS PM]>, I\u2019d be happy to add you to our repo, can I have your github username? This is the link to our project <https://github.com/oct0f1sh/MakeSchoolCompanion>:wave: Hey there! Heard you had an iOS app for attendance. I wanted to take a look :slightly_smiling_face:<@Duncan MacDonald> <@Matthew Harrilal> - Dion is joining because he\u2019d like to get access to your repo. Could you add him?<@Dion Larson [MS PM]> has joined the channelI\u2019d say that all rosters that have PC in the name should support logging in, not just yours..I added the test account to the other roster, maybe that will make a difference. It is the same roster, you are on. I had the test account on another PC roster before. Maybe that\u2019s what caused it to break.<@Duncan MacDonald> sorry for the late reply. I don\u2019t think we have an identifier. Is it necessary for the app?Also I just tested that account again, still causing the app to crash. I\u2019ve got a busy week ahead of me so I\u2019m not sure how soon I\u2019ll be able to look at it, but hopefully I can figure this outI\u2019ll test it right now, but <@Alena Dagneau [Engineering]> is there some kind of term identifier we have for the next product college class? For the last version I was using SPRING 2018 I think, but I remember we talked about this and that there isn\u2019t usually an identifier for PCadded. can you try now?I can add them :slightly_smiling_face:I signed up for an account on the makeschool site, I\u2019ll try making a portfolio tooIs this account listed in the product college roaster? I think we had a system in place to not allow anyone to use the app if they weren\u2019t a verified product college student.If so, you might need to create a portfolio for the user as well. you can choose to not make it public on creation but at least it exists.Is that possibly because the user needs a portfolio?Hmm, still crashing\u2026 Matthew said he would take a look at it tomorrow, as he did all the networking stuff, so I\u2019ll let you know when we have an update.as we don\u2019t do email verification :wink:oh I think that the user doesn\u2019t exist on MS yet, just sign up using that email and password and it should work<@Alena Dagneau [Engineering]> I\u2019m copy/pasting the credentials you gave me, but I\u2019m getting an invalid login/password errorOh right, i\u2019ll do that right nowprobably not at this point but you can log in to Make School and add it yourself on the dashboard :slightly_smiling_face:<@Alena Dagneau [Engineering]> Update: looks like the app is crashing when i try to sign in with that <http://apple.qa|apple.qa> student account, does it have all the student information like first/last name and profile image?Might not be until the end of the day though, I\u2019m at CCSF right now and the internet here is pretty slow and I have to upload another build of the appGreat, I\u2019ll get that all set up with the test flight build. <@Alena Dagneau [Engineering]> I\u2019m going to have you look over the app info when I\u2019m done just to make sure that everything is correct.yep it\u2019s `K=K8G7q2`great, is there a password needed?Sorry took forever but here it is: <mailto:apple.qa@students.makeschool.com|apple.qa@students.makeschool.com>I\u2019m still trying to figure this one out! Pls hold the line\u2026<@Alena Dagneau [Engineering]> braus says that he doesn\u2019t know how to create a new student in the system like thatAlright, I\u2019ve added the MIT license to the repoawesome thanks :slightly_smiling_face:Alright, I can add the MIT license once my class is out<@Duncan MacDonald> - the code needs to a license, so that we could eventually jump in and help out. One license that is pretty standard would be the MIT license. That\u2019s the one <http://Broaden.io|Broaden.io> uses and it gives Make School the right to use the app &amp; the code commercially.I can check with Braus to see if he can make a fake student account for us<@Alena Dagneau [Engineering]>What do you mean license? We don\u2019t currently have any license hosted in our github repo<@Duncan MacDonald> <@Matthew Harrilal> - could you confirm with me what license you used for your project?hm, could you ask Braus to maybe create one for you? Name it <mailto:dev-test@students.makeschool.com|dev-test@students.makeschool.com> ?what you\u2019re askingoh I seemaybe you can use <@Matthew Harrilal>\u2019s email?and I can\u2019t use mine since I signed in with facebookI also need to provide a valid student email address and password so the app store people can test the app<@Alena Dagneau [Engineering]> what should the feedback email be? Should I just list my own email?Working now, I\u2019m uploading to the app store for test flightCan you try again now <@Duncan MacDonald>?I just submitted a support ticket about the issue<@Alena Dagneau [Engineering]> for some reason the team role isn\u2019t updating for me on xcode and I keep getting that same error. I can see on itunesconnect that my role is now an admin, but xcode won\u2019t update from Member and I\u2019m trying to figure out whydid that work then <@Duncan MacDonald> <@Matthew Harrilal>?done!got it, will add you now<@Alena Dagneau [Engineering]> running into another error, looks like I need admin access to upload to test flightAwesome <@Alena Dagneau [Engineering]>, the application is ready to put on testflight accepted the Make School inc invite! Now it's a matter of coordinating with Duncan which I will do so nowso sorry that took so long! I sent you both invites now<@Alena Dagneau [Engineering]> I\u2019m running into an issue where I don\u2019t think I have access to the Make School itunes connect account, I think you might have just added me as a member of the organization. \nFrom stackoverflow:\n&gt;I have encountered exactly the same error today. It turns out that the client has to add the developer in both iTunes Connect and <http://developer.apple.com/membercenter/|developer.apple.com/membercenter/> &gt; People &gt; Invitations (I missed this). Otherwise the new team will not appear in Xcode &gt; Preference &gt; Accounts. Only when the new team shows up, you can then sign the app with new team ID.oh I seem to have the same problem\u2026oh they might have new T&amp;C and I have to accept them, maybe?I\u2019ve submitted a support ticket with Apple, but it looks like it could take up to two days to hear back. I\u2019ll update when I get news.<@Alena Dagneau [Engineering]> I have the app ready for testflight, and I\u2019m trying to go through the process to get it submitted, but I\u2019ve run into a weird error where I just can\u2019t log into itunes connect. I keep entering my login info and then it directs to a page about agreeing to terms and then instantly redirects back to the input login info screen. I\u2019ve tried on multiple browsers but I just can\u2019t get past it\u2026 I\u2019m going to keep trying, but right now this is all that\u2019s holding me back from submitting to test flightkeep me up to date on this!<@Alena Dagneau [Engineering]> Matthew was able to fix the issues I was having, I\u2019m on track to getting the app submitted for test flight approval by tomorrow<@Alena Dagneau [Engineering]> I\u2019ll check with matthew to see if we\u2019re ready<@Duncan MacDonald> <@Matthew Harrilal>Hey there again, how did the weekend go? Any progress?I\u2019ll take a look tonight <@Duncan MacDonald> Quick update: I was able to sort out a lot of UI elements and interactions, but I broke some functionality so I\u2019m just waiting for <@Matthew Harrilal> to take a look<@Alena Dagneau [Engineering]> sorry about the delays, the hold on publishing has been my bad, I\u2019ve told matthew that I would review the UI and refactor the code to get it ready for test flight but I still haven\u2019t taken a look at it. I\u2019ve got two hours of potential job related phone calls today starting at 10:00 am and my Mobile class from 2:00 to 4:00 pm but I\u2019m going to do my best to go over the code and get a version ready for test flight by tomorrow afternoon.<@Duncan MacDonald> <@Matthew Harrilal> ?Is the app live? Do we have real data in the system? We can ask instructors to start encouraging people to install the app, so we can start getting some usage data once we get the go-ahead from you. :slightly_smiling_face:Great! Thanks!accepted!oh, ok on itHey <@Alena Dagneau [Engineering]>, apparently the apple developer TOS have changed and you have to accept them on <http://developer.apple.com|developer.apple.com> before we can ship to test flightAwesome, thanks for the update! Excited to see this go live!!I would have to discuss with <@Duncan MacDonald> regarding the react native applicationThe app is currently finished I meant to show <@Michael Ashby [Engineering]>  but didn\u2019t get a chance to today and we are planning to push to test flight by Thursday<@Matthew Harrilal> <@Duncan MacDonald> - how\u2019s this project coming along? I\u2019d like to add the integration of your data into our system into our next sprint starting May 23. Do you think you will have the app rolled out by then? Any plans on the React Native app?Anxious to see what you are creatingawesome news <@Matthew Harrilal>And per <@Michael Ashby [Engineering]> suggestion I just found a way to log the facebook users out successfully making use of the provider valueSo now the facebook users are having their attendances posted to the database<@Lucas Arruda [Engineering]> I saved the facebook user to the database just with email and first and last name, the reason I'm doing this is to initialize the user with a token to link their attendances<@Michael Ashby [Engineering]> Thankyou!!!A little background on our `User` objects:\n\nThere are 3 relevant fields \u2013 `email`, `preferred_email`, and `provider`. \n\nIf `provider` is `'facebook'`, they\u2019re a Facebook user. Otherwise, `provider` will be `nil`.\n\nFor non-Facebook users, we never use `preferred_email`. Facebook users *might* have a `preferred_email`, but it\u2019s not required (and most don\u2019t).  All users have an `email` property.\n\nPoint being, you can safely rely on `email` to join all users regardless of whether they\u2019re FB users or not. But, if you want to know if a particular user is a FB user, check `provider`They all have user object and email in our system <@Matthew Harrilal>I think you should do the same you are doing with normal studentsThanks! <@Alena Dagneau [Engineering]> <@Lucas Arruda [Engineering]> I have some questions regarding linking attendances to the facebook users. Should I create a new table specifically for fb users and just store their email fullname and a couple other properties and store them in my database, or is there another way to perform this?That\u2019s great <@Matthew Harrilal>Awesome! Great News :slightly_smiling_face:We are able to show their student portfolio page, there is some more refactoring that has to occur to run as smoothly as we can but that should be done by Friday the latest and then from there after your approval we are ready to put on test flightHey <!channel> we are now able to verify the facebook users, tested it on Duncan's account we are going to test with other users tomorrow but just wanted to let you knowI\u2019m on site today if you guys want to make some time<@Matthew Harrilal> I\u2019ll see what I can do\n4pm SF is 8 for me, so I\u2019m off around 3\nbut if I can\u2019t I would guess <@Michael Ashby [Engineering]> could meet with you and I could explain to him what is the issue before he meets with youI have class today at 2 and job search lab this morning is there anyway a video chat can be made after 4?<@Matthew Harrilal> <@Michael Ashby [Engineering]> I\u2019m available today or tomorrowI\u2019m not on site today, but would be happy to do tomorrow (any time after 12)<@Michael Ashby [Engineering]> might be able to join you in person as well today to help debug this.<@Matthew Harrilal> Yes. I can. I spoke with Alena and I have time to meet today Later today ?<@Lucas Arruda [Engineering]> <@Michael Ashby [Engineering]> Are either of you available to discuss the token issue?Sure thing will update you ! <@Lucas Arruda [Engineering]>let me know how it goes <@Matthew Harrilal>yes, try rendering in a way you don\u2019t loose the cookies on your browser/webviewlike I showed you on the postman example\nit\nthe cookie is stored in browser, only <http://makeschool.com|makeschool.com> can access it, but I wouldn\u2019t think that is an issue since login.json is under <http://makeschool.com|makeschool.com>No I will try that, rendering my own web view rendered from the html that is given?I would expect webview to be the same browserdid you try with the frame approach? like having an html frame?However for the app communication to the web view I don't think it shares cookies with urlsessionI think that was a cookie issue, because if it worked on incongnito, it should work on normal modeIt is through the web view like we tested in the hangouts call we saw thatare you sure that you are waiting long enough for the FB callback to happen?hummm that\u2019s weird\nif you are using the same webview or sharing data, though you should not be able to see MS cookie, it should always be set on <http://MS.com|MS.com>the cookies from the web view where the user signed in through facebook and then rerouted to the make school dashboardBut even if I did not have cookies is there a way to go around this?When I do point to /login.json I the response that is coming back encoded in the data is \"you must sign up or sign in before continuing\" which I thought to be that the cookies were not shared from when the users signs in through facebook through the web vieweven if you don\u2019t have those cookies <@Matthew Harrilal> you can still point to /login.json, right? I expect <http://makeschool.com|makeschool.com> cookies to be properly set on the domain and to give you the correct response once you post that<@Lucas Arruda [Engineering]> I got the logic in place I am just trying to find a way no to share the cookies between application and the web view. I will contact you when I have updates! But if you have any advice on this I'd greatly appreciate it$.ajax({\n  method: \u201cPOST\u201d,\n  url: \u201c/login.json\u201d,\n  data: {  }\n})\n  .done(function( msg ) {\n    alert( msg );\n  });$.ajax({\n        type: \u2018POST\u2019,\n        url: \u2018/login.json\u2019,\n        data: {\n        },\n        success: function(data, status, response) {\n           console.log(response);\n        },\n        error: function() {\n          console.log(\u2018Oops, something went wrong\u2019);\n        }\n      });<@Lucas Arruda [Engineering]> Here's the link to the call<https://hangouts.google.com/call/jozmIQtt-Nd3ahCWVEdcAAEE><@Lucas Arruda [Engineering]> I invited you to the callI\u2019m available nowin a few minutes<@Lucas Arruda [Engineering]> are you available now?I\u2019ll also try that later after our meetings in postman <@Matthew Harrilal>because this time, user is logged inand see if you are able to pull user datathen request user to login.json instead of normal loginOk, so I think I\u2019ll try an approach here\nLet user login to FB and let it redirect to MS website in a frame or separate view<@Lucas Arruda [Engineering]>No I didnt manage to get any info @luc]On question <@Matthew Harrilal> \nWhen you try that approach of going redirecting user to FB and then calling FB again, do you manage to get the person\u2019s email?<@Matthew Harrilal>lucasarruda @ gmailalright!<@Lucas Arruda [Engineering]> what is your email by chance?Perfect, I will contact you then on google hangoutsprobably around 12 to 3pm SF timeThanks <@Lucas Arruda [Engineering]> and I am not going to be able to make it to makeschool today but I can video chat you from home. What times are you available?Hey <@Matthew Harrilal>, just to give you some news\nI\u2019m debugging and investigating this, and I hope to come up with a solution\n\nAlso, I\u2019d be happy to hop into a call later today so we can sync/finalize on this if possibleCSRF might be a problem, but we could specifically allow your domainAlright, keep trying thenI will keep trying and let you know of any results <@Lucas Arruda [Engineering]>And when put in Chrome it gives me an authentication errorHello <@Lucas Arruda [Engineering]> I tried the new route and I am getting a different response however it is not the response that we want.<@Matthew Harrilal>and also add params `code` and `state` to `/callback`You can keep the auth token if you have, but pass it like I told you, instead of having `Auth\u2026: Token token=\u2026` (you repeated the word token) have `Authorization: Token 1212121212\u2026`So you are doing /facebook then /facebook/callback, right?The code and state params <@Lucas Arruda [Engineering]> I have to try thatWhen I call the route I am not providing a time because I never get a token but I have not tried the state paramssee `code` and `state`I have a sample callback we get from FB\n\n`/users/auth/facebook/callback?code=AQA75rYQSECSst6hj9J1BGTxAmAFd_\u2026_SpjazLjybZiEp0ihtESn9UHJWt&amp;state=5ca1ca\u202614ed`Hi <@Matthew Harrilal> \nJust to understand, you are first calling `/users/auth/facebook`, and getting the token, right?\nThen you should call `/users/auth/facebook/callback` with `code=` and `state=` params, but JSON\n\nIs that what you are doing? Shouldn\u2019t also it be `Authorization: Token 1212121212\u2026`  instead of repeating `token=`?No problem <@Lucas Arruda [Engineering]> I\u2019m sorry for the delay on my part as well !Sorry for the delay <@Matthew Harrilal> \nI\u2019ll have to look at this on Monday because of the PC pages we need to finalize by this fridayAlright. Let me take a look <@Matthew Harrilal><@Lucas Arruda [Engineering]>The picture I sent is the response I am getting back, when you get a chance can I see the response you are getting backWhat response did you get <@Matthew Harrilal>?\nI can test on postman, because it needs to be tested in prod\nbut I assume it is returning correctlyHey <@Lucas Arruda [Engineering]> we're you able to test the routes and see the json you are getting back for the auth/users/facebook route on postman? If so can I see the json you are getting back because I have tried some different ways to get that json back and to no success. ThanksHey @everyone I'm sorry for the lateness of my task I am going to ask Eliel  for help tomorrow. He is familar with the problem, I will have further updates soon!<@Alena Dagneau [Engineering]> I can have this task done by Saturday morningThat sounds great. What is your timeline on getting the special login done?Hey <@Alena Dagneau [Engineering]> everything is going well, the last part we have to implement before we can push to test flight is the problem that Lucas and I were discussing earlier in the channel. But besides that the functionality has been tested by myself and <@Duncan MacDonald> so I am confident to say that part of the application works, so basically once we get this special login part done we are ready to ship!How are things going here <@Duncan MacDonald> <@Matthew Harrilal>?Thanks <@Lucas Arruda [Engineering]> I will have some time later tonight SF time to try it out, will update you on results!In production now <@Matthew Harrilal>Thanks <@Lucas Arruda [Engineering]> but I\u2019ll try to push tomorrow before SF timeI might not be able to merge that today because we have a few other tasks code sitting on out staging env <@Matthew Harrilal><@Matthew Harrilal>okay, just waiting to see when I can deploy them<@Lucas Arruda [Engineering]> I can see if that works whenever its ready to be tested.Yes, when they press again (JSON request) it should return their data in json (but now it also signs them into MS)So just to clarify, when the user hits the users/auth/facebook route they get the prompt to log into facebook wehn they do it takes them to the dashboard, after that I should close the window and if they press that log in button again it takes them to the dashboard directly. Upon the second time that they press the log in with facebook button I should be expecting a user object back since they are already signed in<@Lucas Arruda [Engineering]> Sure thing<@Matthew Harrilal> I\u2019m deploying a fix to really sign when the request is JSON. Can you check that this fixes your situation?<@Lucas Arruda [Engineering]>So whats currently done is that with  the facebook sdk login we are able to save their credentials and token therefore we can store their session and they can use the app normally however thats not makeschool authenticated so when we hit the users/auth/facebook route what happens is that they are signed in to product college and same for when they press the button to sign in again however no json is being returnedif not, we can see what we can doTell me if that worksAlright <@Matthew Harrilal><@Lucas Arruda [Engineering]> Okay I\u2019m silly, I haven\u2019t tried logging in a second time yet I can get get on that right now, updates will be soon to comeif it works would be awesomecan you try that?yes <@Matthew Harrilal>And when they press that it should make a request to you and return json data <@Lucas Arruda [Engineering]> if it\u2019s not a user, then the JSON will be just something like `{ \"error\": \"Not a user\u2026\" } `After that point in time yes because when they click log in with Facebook it just asks them if they want to continueyesSince the user won\u2019t probably be redirect again to FB, because it\u2019s already logged in, then the your request to us should return just a JSON instead of a redirectTo verify if they actually are a student currentlySo by that then we would have to call the makeschool server again for that user object <@Lucas Arruda [Engineering]>  even if it takes them to their dashboard it doesn\u2019t mean they are a current student right?I see now, if the dashboard appears we can direct them back to use app and since we have a token we can save sessiongot it?the we need to think of a way for us to call you back again with the JSON dataAhhhhbut if that doesn\u2019t workso if you close that window / history.back() / take them to your app again (dunno how it works in your app)\nand you route them automatically as if they clicked Log with FB again, then there are already logged in, app should just render the jsonI mean after they log into Facebook it brings them to their dashboardyesSo when the user hits the users/auth/facebook route they are prompted to log into Facebook when they do it redirects them to <http://makeschool.com|makeschool.com> login pagecurrently, with what we have, if the user logged into FB and it redirect to MS, and then you point them again to `login with facebook`, then it should render you JSON, don\u2019t you think?\nthat could also be an approach<@Matthew Harrilal> what do you think?like I could try posting back to you with the JSON datathat user dataOr maybe, because I\u2019m not sure you will also get the user if it callbacks to you instead of us, we can redirect to youAh I see what your saying <@Lucas Arruda [Engineering]> <@Matthew Harrilal> \nSo even if you had our app_id you wouldn\u2019t be able to do so, setting the callback?\nI think I\u2019ll have to see here when I have some time how can I modify the callback in case it\u2019s you that is calling, so it goes back to you and then you would get the MS student data<@Lucas Arruda [Engineering]> forgive the confusion, from what I understand about saving the session because we have the credentials at that point in time however does logging in through facebook through the use of the facebook sdk it doesn't show us if the user is actually a makeschool student.<@Matthew Harrilal>or have a way to setup a different callback_url (so far I haven\u2019t found an easy way to do it)it\u2019s that or the other thing I mentioned (you ignoring the callback and closing the frame and reloading page querying again and this time you have session)if not, then maybe we need to setup a specific app_id and callback on your SDK so you can user our app to loginok, but if you submit back with that login now you will get the credentials (because time now you are logged to FB)Don't mind the technical difficulties at the beginning <@Lucas Arruda [Engineering]>I am uploading a video now of the facebook login sdk implementation. Using the sdk it returns us back to the application however the MSUserObject doesn't get returnedThis is the implementation of the facebook login sdk <@Lucas Arruda [Engineering]><@Matthew Harrilal>oh, also let me know if you have a specific callback_url, because I think we need to authorize it with app_iddon\u2019t forget to cite me or I don\u2019t get notifiedping me if you needalright <@Matthew Harrilal>but just if the SDK doesn\u2019t work that is a tryWill update you when finished <@Lucas Arruda [Engineering]>and I would probably have to modify our BE to `sign_in @user` into MS once I get that requestAlso, if that doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019m thinking here, another idea would be like some sites do, opening a popup (or similar in mobile) with the fb redirect and let it redirect to site and with that user would be logged in, this way you can redirect them to login in your site and maybe it would workOkay sure thing!Yes, please try that <@Matthew Harrilal>I can implement the facebook login sdk today and for the response object for the user should I just await for your response on that ?let me know what params you need there and if we need to generate and app_id or something like that for you and also if you can configure the callback on your side or we need to do on ours<@Matthew Harrilal> \nok, I\u2019m checking if I can have a different callback, because at the moment, I\u2019m not sure how could I detect that the request came from your app instead and just output that json\n--\nIn the mean time, I guess you could try with the SDK<@Lucas Arruda [Engineering]> Right now how it works is that when the user presses the button to log into the app using facebook it makes a post request to \"<https://www.makeschool.com/users/auth/facebook>\" and then a web view is loaded and that is the facebook login prompt you see in the video above. I think the easier option out of the two that you have listed is using the sdk login and setting the proper call back there. But however you choose to implement just let me know.otherwise we might have to think of using the SDK login and we could set the proper callback therelike if I manage to on the redirect to output a JSON how could you capture this? could you load this inside a frame and once it redirects you could close the frame and refresh user?I\u2019m trying to see how can I modify the callback or don\u2019t redirect if we are outside MSok, let me think <@Matthew Harrilal><@Lucas Arruda [Engineering]> I did have a quick question though so we tested out the route on postman and the facebook prompt displays. On the ios side should we expect when the user logs in through facebook the response object to be returned to us or ?Sorry I deleted the messages because I fixed it but I forgot to delete that messageWhich error?Hey <@Matthew Harrilal>Hey <@Lucas Arruda [Engineering]> I am facing this weird error it was working before now we encounter thisThis is great, thanks!you can find our logos here. let me know if this helps <https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ec8k4fvhmm5dkmr/AADTD4zZmmaYezmI-S_zSlKua?dl=0>Hi <@Mona Desai [Design]>, my idea for the logo was just a simple MakeSchool logo. Do we have any iOS icons already made that we can use?and if there is anything I can help you withSure thing <@Lucas Arruda [Engineering]> Alright. Let me know how it goes <@Matthew Harrilal>Okay awesome thanks so much <@Alena Dagneau [Engineering]> <@Lucas Arruda [Engineering]> Make School is going on a trip to yelp today so I will have time after to implement<@Matthew Harrilal> \nRoute should be `/users/auth/facebook` and it\u2019s best if you use POST\nYou might also need the FB JS SDK so you don\u2019t redirect people to FB and then back to us (probably the default FB callback for our app_id)Exactly <@Alena Dagneau [Engineering]>, we have just deployed this and it should be ready to be tested\nOne thing to notice is that user can\u2019t signup via Facebook. It needs to have an account attached to FB.\nSo only FB login will work for now<@Lucas Arruda [Engineering]> has merged in the code to support FB auth yesterday. He should be able to give you more info on this today :slightly_smiling_face:Invitations to become a dev on on our ORG account have been sent :smile: Finally!!Awesome <@Alena Dagneau [Engineering]> and does there happen to be any updates towards the Facebook auth feature ?I was enrolled successfully and just paid for our membership. That can take up to 48 hrs but hopefully I can finally add you to the ORG account tmrw!<@Duncan MacDonald> if you can provide some more info on what you need help with that would be great. We can also connect quickly sometime on Monday if that\u2019s easieryou got it! <http://make.sc/portfolio|make.sc/portfolio> now exists :slightly_smiling_face:An icon would be really great, and we\u2019re not designers so that would be great if <@Mona Desai [Design]> could help us with that. Also, the short link would be really convenient for portfolio links, so instead of typing <http://makeschool.com/portfolio/duncan|makeschool.com/portfolio/duncan> it would be nice to have <http://make.sc/portfolio/duncan|make.sc/portfolio/duncan> to save screen spaceLet me know how I can help :slightly_smiling_face:<@Mona Desai [Design]> has joined the channelTwo more things I wanted to follow up on:\n- Do you still want an API shortlink? We've discussed it in a meeting once and it totally slipped my radar. \n- Do you want help with your launch icon still? I reached out to Mona, our designer, and she's happy to help!That sounds great, thanks for the updateLucas is going to start working on this in this sprint, so he'll be reaching out to you if needed and update you on the progress of that task :slightly_smiling_face:Still waiting on Apple to enroll MS as an org to the Apple Dev program but I'm 1 step further! Will update as soon as I know more. I talked to BE devs and we think it would take 1-2 days of work to add the FB auth feature. I'm currently figuring out when we can add this to our work load. Will update you today on this.Hey <@Duncan MacDonald> <@Matthew Harrilal> - let me check with Lucas &amp; Michael if there's anything we can do on short notice. Will get back to you.Hey <@Alena Dagneau [Engineering]>, our main hurdle right now is Facebook auth and we really can\u2019t move on without it. Is there any way that we can figure out how to do this on the backend? Once we have Facebook Auth we\u2019ll be ready to shipThe DUNS number has been updated but it can take 2 weeks before it's updated on Apple's side :disappointed: I'll be checking every day if they'll let me create an account yet.. Will update as soon as I have it.<@Alena Dagneau [Engineering]>Either have them to have separated accounts for now or create a task to check how feasible is to add this.\n\nIn the task we can check the approach of everyone from FB should have also set password vs the ability of doing oauth via ajax and returning user data the same way we do with normal FB login<@Lucas Arruda [Engineering]> - is there anything we can do from our side to help sort out the Facebook login or what is the best plan of action here?And ditto on what <@Duncan MacDonald> saidHey everyone I just wanted to share a quick update the new login has been updated and I tested it out with a few people however the only people it fails for as <@Duncan MacDonald> said the ones who have facebook login. Currently working on linking the attendance data to the user on the client side which should be done by the end of today.Alright, in the mean time we can try to load the app through Xcode onto people\u2019s phones. That also should hopefully give us time to figure out Facebook login integration Hey <@Matthew Harrilal> <@Duncan MacDonald> - I\u2019m really sorry but it\u2019s taking longer than expected! To sign up as an organization, I need to get access to a DUNS number and ours seems to have the wrong legal name on it. I requested to change it but they said, it might take up to business 5 days for that to happen :disappointed: I\u2019ll update you as soon as I hear back from them.. I hope it won\u2019t block you too much!That might be a case where we need an account in system <@Michael Ashby [Engineering]> <@Duncan MacDonald> \nWithout the password we would probably need a way to integrate with facebook in oauth in ajax mode\nThere is probably a way to do it, but I\u2019m not sure of the effort to do itThat\u2019s a good question. I\u2019ll look into it, but I probably won\u2019t have time until Monday.  <@Lucas Arruda [Engineering]> Do you know the answer?So it occurs to me that I signed up to my makeschool account with my facebook and that prevents me from using the sign in API that we set up. Is there a way that we can implement that sign in with facebook button to the app?Hey <@Alena Dagneau [Engineering]>  my apple developer email is <mailto:matthewharrilal@gmail.com|matthewharrilal@gmail.com>Hey <@Alena Dagneau [Engineering]> my apple developer email is <mailto:buzzbuzz.macdonald@gmail.com|buzzbuzz.macdonald@gmail.com>`<mailto:matthewharrilal@gmail.com|matthewharrilal@gmail.com>``<https://www.makeschool.com/login.json>`sure that works: <https://plus.google.com/hangouts/_/makegameswith.us/attendance?hceid=YWxlbmFAbWFrZXNjaG9vbC5jb20.2bavvpgbp67bjbchna7d6dp10i&amp;authuser=0><@Michael Ashby [Engineering]> We\u2019re in Derbyshire againShould we use a google hangout or a slack call?<@Duncan MacDonald> <@Matthew Harrilal> <@Michael Ashby [Engineering]> - let me know when you\u2019re ready to add me online for today\u2019s meeting :slightly_smiling_face:<@Matthew Harrilal> - yep that\u2019s exactly it. You can see that in the first screenshot Lucas posted :slightly_smiling_face:Good morning everyone, thanks Lucas for the files so if I\u2019m running this on my machine what would be the url I would use, is it <http://makeschool.com/login.json>?slackbot notified that you couldn'toh ok, niceThankswe can see your files Lucas :slightly_smiling_face:<https://www.dropbox.com/sh/pnzi4ds6k1ud5uc/AACK1QNKPPfH-OuW6ykgRYjHa?dl=0>let me share with you via Dropboxoh, slack rejected my filesand the response:see my sample login request on Postman <@Matthew Harrilal> :yes, <@Alena Dagneau [Engineering]><@Lucas Arruda [Engineering]> - can you chime in here?<@Alena Dagneau [Engineering]> thanks! I am still confused about the request to the /login does the user pass the email and password as parameters or some other way?/login I believe :slightly_smiling_face: <@Lucas Arruda [Engineering]> correct me if I\u2019m wrong!Hey <@Alena Dagneau [Engineering]> sorry for the late response, I was wondering what the route was to get that MS user object is?That\u2019s awesome, I\u2019ll have to check with matthew if that\u2019s enough but thanks for updating us!<@Duncan MacDonald> <@Matthew Harrilal> \n\nHappy Monday! I\u2019ve just spoken to the engineers about allowing your users to authenticate to Make School and we actually already support that! The only thing is what object you get returned after your user logs in. \n\nCurrently we\u2019re returning a simple user object, which lets you know that the user is a MS user. \n\n```\n{\n    \"id\": 12345,\n    \"email\": \"<mailto:lucas@makeschool.com|lucas@makeschool.com>\",\n    \"created_at\": \"2017-01-11T20:31:29.048Z\",\n    \"updated_at\": \"2018-02-25T15:28:05.676Z\",\n    \"provider\": null,\n    \"uid\": null,\n    \"first_name\": \"Lucas\",\n    \"last_name\": \"Arruda\",\n    \"stripe_id\": null,\n    \"academy\": false,\n    \"role\": \"admin\",\n    \"academy_cohort_id\": 194,\n    \"profile_image_url\": \"<https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/7B6hXOY0TU6p9KCV2IYr>\",\n    \"waiting_since\": null,\n    \"secure_uploads\": null,\n    \"hubspot_vid\": 29495005,\n    \"preferred_email\": null,\n    \"personal_referral_code\": \"alpha-designer-lucas\",\n    \"newsletter_subscriber\": false,\n    \"failure_count\": 0\n}\n```\n\nWe\u2019re going to modify the user object to return an auth_token, so you can use it on subsequent API calls to portfolios.json and the rosters.json. I think that should give you all the functionality plus an authenticated user. Am I missing something?In regards to having the login API call, I\u2019m putting it up for discussions on the ENG team early next week and will get back to you on a timeline and if we will actually be able to deliver this to you before you\u2019re finished with the app. TBD.<@Duncan MacDonald> <@Matthew Harrilal> - just wanted to keep you in the loop about the Make School iOS dev account. I\u2019ve reached out to people in the know and found out that our current MS dev account is expired. I\u2019m still talking to Jeremy &amp; Ashu about getting it back and then having you credited on the app somehow. \n\nI\u2019m thinking what will most likely happen is that we will have your codebase be open source under an MIT license and then we can reference it in the About section of the app but release it under the MS name. I\u2019ll have access details early next week. Does this sound good with you?here\u2019s the hangouts :slightly_smiling_face:<https://hangouts.google.com/hangouts/_/makegameswith.us/meet-w-duncan?authuser=0>Shall we meet in the Hangouts event?Invite sent :slightly_smiling_face:Yes that time works! See you tmrw :slightly_smiling_face:<@Alena Dagneau [Engineering]> I talked to <@Duncan MacDonald> would 10am work? It's because we have morning huddles. I will show you a demo of application as well!<@Matthew Harrilal> <@Duncan MacDonald>Hi there, just wanted to gently nudge scheduling that meeting. I\u2019d be free tmrw at 9am or 3pm. Could we do a meeting then?<@Alena Dagneau [Engineering]> Same as what Duncan said we are able to post the data of the beacon when the user connects to the beacon. In addition to this the beacons data is linked to a specific user so we can accurately track who is connecting. Also log in has been implemented as well as sign up, we still need to work on a couple more kinks for the sign up but we are basically 95% done with the mvp!perfect, thanks!<@Alena Dagneau [Engineering]> That sounds like it would be a great idea. I\u2019ll communicate with Matthew and try to get time to show you guys what we haveDo you think it would be a good idea to have a demo with myself &amp; Michael to give us an overview of what you have so far and we can give feedback on the existing features and what we\u2019d like to see in the future <@Duncan MacDonald>?<@Alena Dagneau [Engineering]> So far so good, the project has gone really well. We\u2019ve completed 95% of the MVP, just a couple more little things to sort out before we can submit it and get it shipped. The project is definitely still in progress though, so far we only have the attendance tracking feature but we want to expand and implement a lot more.<@Matthew Harrilal> <@Duncan MacDonald> - hello! How is the project going? Did you get a code review from <@Michael Ashby [Engineering]>? I remember you wanted to complete it with the end of the term last friday. Did you manage to succeed in that goal? Where does that leave this project? Will you continue to work on this?And latest update the beacon data is being posted to the database when the beacon connects which essentially means when they enter the building a timestamp is sent of when the event occurred and whether the individual is leaving or entering. The next step is to implement log in and sign up on the client side so we can grab the users token dynamically. I will have that feature hopefully done by this weekend, once implemented <@Michael Ashby [Engineering]> may I schedule another code review to show the server side changes?receiving*Yes <@Alena Dagneau [Engineering]> I am storing the user id in the database and the next step is comparing the id's we are recieving in the portfolio json against the roster api id's to see who is an active Product College Student<@Matthew Harrilal> <@Duncan MacDonald>We killed the review app that hosted the API, but unfortunately we\u2019re not ready to promote to production until Monday.  For the weekend, the rosters API can be accessed at <https://staging.makeschool.com/api/rosters/>\u2026<@Matthew Harrilal> <@Duncan MacDonald> - are you storing our user id in your database along with an individual\u2019s record?Thanks all and <@Michael Ashby [Engineering]> I will locate you tomorrow! Have a good night all, I am going to be signing off nowYeah have <@Michael Ashby [Engineering]> or <@Lucas Arruda [Engineering]> do your BE code review and I can do FE if there\u2019s any? <@Lucas Arruda [Engineering]> is currently on vacation for 2 weeks, so <@Michael Ashby [Engineering]> is a better bet for now :smile: Also it will most likely be him, who\u2019s going to either build the Android version or React Native app once you\u2019re done, so it\u2019s good for him to understand what the requirements are on the mobile app.Okay for sure I will come and find you!:+1: I\u2019ll take a look in the morning, and how about meeting for a few minutes tomorrow afternoon?  I\u2019m available any time after 1!*And by the way this is a link only for the backend?Thanks and should we discuss a time in which we can talk about it or are you going to open issues?<https://github.com/matthewharrilal/MakeCompanionBackend>I\u2019m happy to do a code review\u2013send me a linkAnd one more tidbit we have implemented log in and sign up on the server side after we are done with the beacon data on the client side we will implement the log in and sign up flow on the client side!Will have further updates soon, but as of now Duncan and I are working on the client side to be able to send the beacon data to the database. If any of you <@Michael Ashby [Engineering]> <@Lucas Arruda [Engineering]> <@Alena Dagneau [Engineering]> have free time I would love to have a code review!<@Alena Dagneau [Engineering]> Sorry just saw this message, we are using token based authentication for user authentication and currently the only users that are allowed to sign in only if they are on the portfolios. The backend to store them is done but hasn't been code reviewed which I would love to show any of you. And for what we are storing in the database for the users is there makeschool email and their token and then for the attendance portion of the application we are storing is their current user's identification, as well as the id of the beacon and what time the user enters and leavesThis is great, thank you so much. We will try to get this implemented soon and let you know if we run into any issues. Again, at the moment, this API can be accessed at `<https://makeschool-staging-pr-1945.herokuapp.com/api/rosters>`, and we\u2019ll move it over to `<http://makeschool.com|makeschool.com>` in the coming days.  If you have any questions, or if you want some help consuming the API, let me know.  I\u2019ll be working on site most days, so if you want some time, just reach out.  And of course, I\u2019ll keep you updated as we build this out`api/rosters/current-students` is even more direct, as it returns the IDs of all students who are currently attending Make School`api/rosters/current-session-rosters` returns an array of IDs for all currently active rosters (ex: `[2, 4]`). This will be useful for finding out if a student is currently attending Make School`api/rosters` returns a JSON with all rosters, and `/api/rosters/:id` returns the roster with a given idWe opened 4 endpoints:\n`/api/rosters`\n`/api/rosters/:id`\n`/api/rosters/current-session-rosters`\n`/api/rosters/current-students`\n...<@Matthew Harrilal> <@Duncan MacDonald> We\u2019re rolling out the rosters API right now, but it\u2019s going to take us a few days to work out some details (e.g., authentication).  In the meantime, you can access the API on our review app at <https://makeschool-staging-pr-1945.herokuapp.com/>\n\u2026 (cont\u2019d)how are you allowing users to signup/login? Are you keeping track of users on your own DB?Our deliverables are that by the end of the day on Friday we plan to have user creation/sign in implemented and functionality for the mobile client to send in/out information to the server using beacon regions. Hey Alena, on the backend everything is going well in the process of implementing log in and sign up functionality!Awesome, that sounds really awesome! Can you let me know again, what you hope to deliver by which date?Hi <@Alena Dagneau [Engineering]>, we\u2019re making great progress. I\u2019ve been able to get the beacon functionality working along with a semi functional login screen and Matthew is working hard on the backend side. Right now my computer is shipped off to be repaired but hopefully I\u2019ll have it back in the next two days or so. Hi <@Matthew Harrilal> &amp; <@Duncan MacDonald> - how\u2019s the project looking? how far along are you currently and is there anything we can do to help/review?Thanks for the update!At the moment, we\u2019re keeping them but as we\u2019re scaling it will be expensive to do this when we will have more students, so we will most likely turn it off at that time. However for this particular feature, you shouldn\u2019t count on it and as Michael says above, the roster API will solve your problem without relying on emails :slightly_smiling_face:It\u2019s semi-permanentI suspect that it\u2019s permanent\u2013next week we\u2019ll open up the rosters API, and then we can sync on how to use that to determine whether students are activeThat sounds great, thanks for the update. Do you know if that email functionality is going to be permanent or is there a way that we can deactivate those student emails?also an update from our side: <@Michael Ashby [Engineering]> &amp; <@Lucas Arruda [Engineering]> are working on opening our roster API this week, so hopefully we have something working for by EOW<@Duncan MacDonald> <@Matthew Harrilal> - students keep their emails atm when they leave Make Schoolmichaelashby &amp; lucasarruda<@Michael Ashby [Engineering]> <@Lucas Arruda [Engineering]> can I get your github usernames?<@Michael Ashby [Engineering]> has joined the channel<@Lucas Arruda [Engineering]> has joined the channel<@Alena Dagneau [Engineering]> has joined the channel<@Matthew Harrilal> has joined the channel<@Duncan MacDonald> set the channel purpose: MakeSchool Companion App<@Duncan MacDonald> has joined the channel"

Although `self` has a special name, it works like any other variable, so you can use it like this: `self[word] = 1`.Here\u2019s the Markov chain diagram I showed in class. You can ignore the `START` and `STOP` tokens and states for now, we will revisit this later when we build more complex (higher order) Markov chains later in the course.In case you had this question because you\u2019re _only_ looking at the progress tracker, all challenges are listed in greater detail on the repo\u2019s class page.

Once you have figured that out, you can google ways to remove items (in your case, the string - \u201crearrange.py\u201d) from that data structure in Python. Splicing may be one of them, but it may also lead to more confusion.You could slice the array of arguments to exclude the first argument\nsys.argv[1:]If anyone could help me with this bug it would be greatly appreciated: Whenever I run this code snippet it also prints the file name (rearrange.py) along with the command line arguments.

It was like 2 am last night and my application kept crashing from excessive memory usage, so I was thinking \"Let's see how effective the queue can be\" and it actually blew me away with how a simple DS could work so effectively. The word_list was approximately 4-10 gigs with my final markov path being 10gb. I used the queue to keep track of words in the current context and then dispose the ones of that weren't required anymore. With this optimization, as my markov model scaled up it was able to actually complete because of the constant disposal of words I no longer needed. <@Jasmine Humbert> also showed me object serialization with `pickle`, which allows you to serialize objects in their current state into a byte array that can then be saved into a binary file and deserialized later. This will reduce the load up time by a little bit as you don't have to create the markov model, rather just read in the byte array and then deserialize it to get a previously created one.yea pickle won't save you hereWhew. Only 21x that lmaoYeah there\u2019s a ~500mb limit hahaI was able to create an 8th order markov chain with a corpus of 44 million words using a queue to delete the words after I was done with them, but I don't think if Heroku is going to be okay with my application using 10.7 GB of memory : (Sick front-end <@Tim Kaing> well i never saw THAT comingthat last one was posted by a friend of mine from portlandsnaps to vincenzo and stephen for unblocking me*Stretch challenge:* Build a corporate logo and motto generator. <https://twitter.com/hugwins/status/1071269167544852482>this really speaks to meThat's deep.<https://tweet-generator-nak.herokuapp.com/>\n<https://twitter.com/frankensteinen1>\nFrankenstein lives!what can you do with a corpus of 100 million+ words?

Basically, you just start a *Slack voice or video call* in the appropriate channel and invite other people to join it.

It\u2019s passed to your find() method when called. Whoever is doing the calling passes their own custom function. You can see the ones used in the linkedlist test file under test_find(self).\n\nTo call this function within your method, you just call quality(item) like any other function.I can see that quality is a parameter in the function.\n\nI can't find the quality() function that evaluates to true or false though. Is that something you custom-implemented?You can see that quality is a parameter in your function - it\u2019s also a function itself, one that compares two items and returns True or False based on the comparisonis it the equivalent of a search term?what does quality mean in this sentence?

Two things you might want to clarify. First, many people may need to use `touch requirements.txt` to create the file before using pip freeze. Also gunicorn -w 4 creates 4 worker threads and its file_name:entry_point. so if your file is named server.py and inside this file you have `app = flask(__name__)` then you would use `gunicorn server:app`Also flask can use .env files if you choose to take that route.

Although `self` has a special name, it works like any other variable, so you can use it like this: `self[word] = 1`.Did you notice the top of the test files right after the import, or is it a different issue?Anyone figure out the __ override to make `self.assertCountEqual(dictogram, self.fish_dict)` pass?:+1:, thanks ! I\u2019ll check it out!you should check that resource out, it's amazing!<https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/>Ah, okay. I think I understand...virtual env overwrites your `$PATH` so that it checks your virtual environment for executables first. The way I like to think about virtual environment is by relating it to how npm works. Project dependencies get installed into your project folder and tools/sdks get installed globally (Or in your home directory, depending on your npm configuration) :slightly_smiling_face:install it within the virtual environment(So by they way, I'm a new programmer.)should we install Flask only within the virtual environment, globally, or locally? (maybe this is a dumb question...) I only ask, because the \"install Flask\" section comes right after the virtual environment section. I'm guessing we should install it outside of the virtual environment, normally (without sudo) within the tweet-generator folder.*Due Thursday 11/8:* Challenges on code quality, organization, and application architecture, along with starter code and unit tests for refactoring histogram functions into class instance methods: <https://github.com/Product-College-Courses/CS-1.2-How-Data-Structures-Work/blob/master/Lessons/Architecture.md>:make-school::link::github: GitHub repo for CS 1.2: How Data Structures Work is available <!here>: <http://make.sc/cs12-repo|make.sc/cs12-repo>\nFriendly reminder that the CS 1.2 progress tracker &amp; class attendance is here: <http://make.sc/cs12-progress|make.sc/cs12-progress>Today\u2019s first activity is to review a partner\u2019s code with this *Code Review Rubric*: <http://make.sc/code-review-rubric|make.sc/code-review-rubric>\n(Feel free to print this out and use it to review your own (or a classmate\u2019s) project codebase any time.)I made a PR for this LOL, try <http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/quickstart/>is anybody else getting a broken link for the flask quickstart tutorial?CS Tutoring in the great hall today from 11:30 to 1pm.:thinking_face:Tutoring today from 5:30-7:30 in the Great Hall.<@Joe Rezendes> has left the channeland dont forget to add and commit your changes before doing \"git push heroku master\", hope you find this helpfulGood morning, for those who are having trouble deploying flask app to heroku, check out this good article <https://medium.com/the-andela-way/deploying-a-python-flask-app-to-heroku-41250bda27d0>That's cobra??They\u2019re probably better visualizers, but this is the one I know aboutIf you need help understanding what your python code is doing, or what\u2019s going on during each iteration, I like using this visualizer: <http://www.pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit>Friendly reminder to :white_check_mark::python: *update your current progress* on the Tweet Generator tutorial by *12pm today* and :github::link: *add a link to your GitHub repo* on the CS 1.2 Progress Tracker <!here>: <http://make.sc/cs12-progress|make.sc/cs12-progress>GRAPHS ARE FIXED NOW!Your work is very much appreciatedgraphs came out weird sorry guys but it you look at my code it looks good<https://github.com/sadboykj/class_activities/blob/master/cs1_2/18.11.01_sampling.md>&gt; may or may notrandom.uniform is a strange function\n&gt; random.uniform(a, b)\n&gt; Return a random floating point number N such that a &lt;= N &lt;= b for a &lt;= b and b &lt;= N &lt;= a for b &lt; a.\n&gt;\n&gt; The end-point value b may or may not be included in the range depending on floating-point rounding in the equation a + (b-a) * random().Tutoring in the great hall today until 1pm if anyone needs help.CS Tutoring today from 5:30-7:30 in the great hall. <https://github.com/sadboykj/class_activities/blob/master/cs1_2/18.10.30_histogram.md>Aw, thanks. <@Jamie McCrory> has an even faster solution Notes on probability and stochastic sampling from class today that will help you work through tutorial page 4Here\u2019s my in-practice \u201clist of lists\u201d solution: <https://github.com/DacioRomero/Tweet-Generator/blob/e3472fe9d2d87c61aaa707a8b5bc1e63f4a02d38/histogram.py#L29><@Nolan Kovacik> set the channel topic: CS 1.2: Tweet Generator course discussion and resources \u2014 progress tracker: <http://make.sc/cs12-progress|make.sc/cs12-progress>To clarify, let\u2019s use this example text:\n&gt;one fish two fish red fish blue fish\n\u2022 total words (tokens): 8\n\u2022 unique words (types): 5\n\u2022 frequency of \u201cfish\u201d: 4At the yelp field trip Yeah, I figured that is what it was.\n\nSince even if the word is used more than once, it is still a unique word itself.

I had this bug before too :blush: Good job Dacio!!I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a more efficient way of doing this tooApologies for the long post, I just though it would be helpful :sweat_smile:In some of your GitHub repos I\u2019ve seen something along the lines of this for the \u201clist of lists\u201d challenge for the histogram:\n```\nfor word in sentence:\n    if word not in histogram:\n        histogram.append([word, 1])\n    for occurences in histogram:\n        if occurences[0] == word:\n            occurences[1] += 1\n```\nI thought something didn\u2019t make sense, so I tested them and got a lot of *duplicates* such as `[['foobar', 1], ['foobar', 2]]`.\n\n*Why it doesn\u2019t work*\nPython is checking if a `string` is in the histogram (`list`) of records (`list`).\n`in` doesn\u2019t check the if the `string` is inside one of `list`s in the histogram (`list`), rather if the `string` is _equivalent_ (`==`) to each of the `list`s which will be `False` as a `string` does not `==` a `list`.\nInstead, _for each_ word it ends up `append`ing `[word, 1]` to the histogram (`list`) and increments any matching records resulting in *duplicates*.\n\n*Solutions*\nOne solution would be to prepopulate your histogram (`list`) with each record (`list`) record to 0 (i.e. `[[word1, 0], [word2, 0]]`) and remove `if word in histogram:` part.\nAnother would be:\n```\nfor word in sentence:\n    for occurences in histogram:\n        if occurences[0] == word:\n            occurences[1] += 1\n            break\nelse:\n    histogram.append([word, 1])\n```\n\n*How it works*\nPython looks for a record that matches the current word and increments it and `break`s out of the loop if it does.\nIf it never `break`s out it runs the `else:` clause, so it `append`s `[word, 1]` to the histogram.\n\nI haven\u2019t tested this code yet, but I think it\u2019ll help those who were having problems with *duplicates*.\nPersonally, I still like the `dictionary` method the best.<@Alan Davis [CS]> Cool!

Feel free to come by to learn more about CS topics or prepare for interviews. If there are enough people today, we will split into groups and have group led learning sessions based off of what people are looking to learn. Come with some topics that you would like to explore! <!here><https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/><http://courses.csail.mit.edu/iap/interview/materials.php>There's a staircase with N steps, and you can climb 1 or 2 steps at a time.\nGiven N, write a function that returns the number of unique ways you can\nclimb the staircase. The order of the steps matters.\n\nFor example, if N is 4, then there are 5 unique ways:\n\n1, 1, 1, 1\n2, 1, 1\n1, 2, 1\n1, 1, 2\n2, 2\nWhat if, instead of being able to climb 1 or 2 steps at a time, you could climb\nany number from a set of positive integers X? For example, if X = {1, 3, 5},\nyou could climb 1, 3, or 5 steps at a time. Generalize your function to take in X.I typed in \"hard interview question\" into google:woah :brain::rocket:Oh yes you're right Jamie, it's O(1) for dict and O(n) for collections. Your explanation is pretty solid. Thank You man <@Jamie McCrory>Here's a one line O(n+k) solution: `sum(ord(c) for c in text1) == sum(ord(c) for c in text2)`import collections\n\ndef check_permutation_of(string1,string2):\n    return collections.Counter(string1) == collections.Counter(string2)\n\nstring1 = 'ABC'\nstring2 = 'CBA'\nstring3 = \"CCBA\"\n\nprint(check_permutation_of(string1,string3))\u201cIn\u201d operation has O(1) time complexity with hash tables, but yeah, don\u2019t use a set. Use collections.counter. If you had a corpus of many words and for each word you were checking each character against the pattern that would be O(n**2), but since you only have one word, the length of the word, n, and you\u2019re not iterating through n in a nested fashion, you add the n\u2019s together for each iteration to make an overall time complexity of O(2n) like Ansel said. You iterate through the first word to make a dictogram and then iterate through the second word in a separate for loop (n+n). Or maybe you could do collections.counter on both words and see if the resulting dictionaries are the same? I think that would be O(2n) time complexity too, but would be much easier to write. It\u2019s like sorting the strings and checking to see if they\u2019re the same, but with better runtime (O(n) instead of O(nlogn) of sorting). Idk. Maybe someone else want to chime in?Nice <@Jamie McCrory> but checking if a char is in the set(i assume using the in keyword) while traversing the second string wouldn't be O(n^2) ?That sounds like a valid solution <@Ansel Bridgewater>, trying it rn!Nice, you\u2019re right. I guess the dict values are counts that you could decrement as you go through the second word?If all characters are in a set, you might miss out on duplicate characters. I think a dictionary would catch those and still be O(n) (at most you would go through all characters in the first word twice for O(2n))Add each character of one string to a set and then iterate through the second string checking to see if the characters are in the set. Time complexity: O(n+m) the length of the two strings.Given two strings,write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the\nother. Example : \"ABC\" and \"BCA\" are perm of each other. Thanks.Hey guys, could anyone help me find a solution for this question that has runtime better than O(n log n) ?<https://media.giphy.com/media/l0Extsf1R5YuFXkpG/giphy.gif>Also it\u2019s probably not worth it if you don\u2019t have a lot of repeat items in the input array.Looks really good!

Depth was interesting to see and did help me to start debugging.\n\nBut after some sleep, I figured out a much cleaner way to do this:My solution to Leetcode's unique email counter in Python: <https://gist.github.com/nsafai/458005c25c477456a58fa3801aba3fe8>\n\nProblem: <https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-email-addresses/>\n\nRecommend trying the problem before reading the solution. It's an easy problem that is apparently quite common in initial tech screens. Welcome feedback on how I could make it better!<@Phyllis Wong> has left the channelI also added this as the first line:\n```def isValid(self, s, depth=0):\n    print('\\nRecursion depth:', depth)\n```\nwhich will help you visualize it.I think it\u2019ll help you understand to add `print` before + after the recursive call to `self.isValid`, kinda like this:\n```print('making recursive call')\nself.isValid(s2, depth+1)\nprint('ended recursive call')```hmm but shouldn't it only go through the function once, and then exit with the input it is testing? `self.isStillValid(\"()\")`We\u2019re not crazy. Python\u2019s not bananas. Everything\u2019s actually working correctly.I just figured it out! This is happening because it\u2019s a recursive function and the print outs are happening while the recursive call stack is being built up and torn down, so it\u2019s printing out in an unexpected order, but it\u2019s executing exactly as you\u2019ve coded it to!My guess is Leet's simulator is for some reason running asynchronouslyIt's like you somehow got it to run multiple inputs concurrently. Is Python turning into Go? :thinking_face::python::arrow_right::gopher: Maybe print 's' beside the \"inside enumerate\" and \"empty string\", to be sure it actually *is* somehow running the same value after the returnyou know, that does make me feel better :joy::flushed: I\u2019m dumbfounded. :exploding_head::wtf::python::troll:and yet it's going inside the enumerate :wtf:If you `enumerate('')` (an empty string) the `for` loop simply will not runAdd a `print` to the `for i, _ in enumerate(s)` block to totally prove it.I don\u2019t see the issue you\u2019re talking about. I see that it\u2019s executing `isValid` 3 times and it works as expected when given `''` the 2nd and 3rd time. Notice `after return` is never printed.Show me more code! I\u2019ve got about 100 more where that came from\u2026 :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:Do you know why it's not respecting the `return True` -- on line 36 of the Gist and continuing on to the `for i, _ in enumerate(s)` on line 38 ?nice i like that optimization.  Here's the gist: <https://gist.github.com/nsafai/ca7838ae9b804f627590e4d97762b763>Or you can use a dictionary to match: ```\ndef isMatching(prev, outer):\n    match = {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}\n    return prev in match and outer == match[prev]```Also, there\u2019s a much simpler way: :wink:\n```def isMatching(self, prev, outer):\n        if prev == \"(\":\n            return outer == \")\":\n        if prev == \"{\":\n            return outer == \"}\":\n        if prev == \"[\":\n            return outer == \"]\":\n```I recommend making a Gist on GitHub or a Slack snippet, which formats code and allows you to update it later.<@Ali Shalabi> has joined the channelhey <@Ali Shalabi> and i were tackling this problem (<https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/>) when we encountered a perplexing issue:\n\n*Our code is not exiting the function after the `return True` statement inside `isValid()`.*\n\nDoes anybody know why this is happening?\n\n```class Solution:\n    def isValid(self, s: str) -&gt; bool:\n        print(\"s is:\" + s + \".\")\n        print(\"len(s) is:\" + str(len(s)) + \".\")\n        if s == \"\":\n            print('empty string')\n            return True\n            print('after return')\n        for i, _ in enumerate(s):\n            if s[i] == \")\" or \"]\" or \"}\":\n                prev = s[i-1]\n                prev_idx = i - 1\n                outer = s[i]\n                outer_idx = i\n                if self.isMatching(prev, outer) == False:\n                    return False\n                else:\n                    s1 = s.replace(prev, '', 1)\n                    s2 = s1.replace(outer, '', 1)\n                    self.isValid(s2)\n\n    def isMatching(self, prev, outer):\n        if prev == \"(\":\n            if outer == \")\":\n                return True\n            else:\n                return False\n        if prev == \"{\":\n            if outer == \"}\":\n                return True\n            else:\n                return False\n        if prev == \"[\":\n            if outer == \"]\":\n                return True\n            else:\n                return False```\n\nreturns:\n```s is:().\nlen(s) is:2.\ns is:.\nlen(s) is:0.\nempty string\ns is:.\nlen(s) is:0.\nempty string\nNone```I'll be there but will be kinda late<@Duncan MacDonald> has left the channelI\u2019m an oblong so I might be there!<!channel> Tech interview club :desktop_computer: meeting today at 1:30pm :calendar: hosted at Make School :make-school:.

Using the following mock Instagram API routes, implement a solution that returns Instagram Profile objects like below, given a seed instagram ID. Like a graph, view the profiles as the nodes, and the followers as the edges.\n\n\n```\nGET /profile/&lt;instagram_id&gt;\n{\n  username: string,\n  biography: string,\n  follower_count: int,\n}\n\nGET /profile/&lt;instagram_id&gt;/followers?cursor=&lt;cursor&gt;\n{\n  data: [\n    id,         // string\n    id,         // string\n    ...\n  ],\n  cursor: int   // can be null\n}\n```\n\nThe data returned should be the following structure (implemented in Python, but the program can written in any language):\n\n```\nclass InstagramProfile:\n  def __init__(self, profile_id, username, biography, follower_count, followers):\n    self.profile_id = profile_id\n    self.username = username\n    self.biography = biography\n    self.follower_count = follower_count\n    self.followers = followers             // needs to be filled with Profile Objects, not IDs\n\n```\n\nNotes: The returned array of followers must be all `Profiles`, not IDs, including the inner followers list. The cursor in the `followers` route can be `null`. Assume the server can handle the storage space of all the instagram profiles.My CZI interview code pairing session challenge was:\nBuild an AI tic-tac-toe where X always wins. If you haven\u2019t built tic-tac-toe before, or the logic is a little rusty, this is a good thing to practice.I did this one today, or at least tried to... Great work! (Mine was the max sum problem above.)I have been been looking for ways to better document the meetings that we host so people can still see what we did at each meeting. Below is a document that I wrote up that goes through the question we went through last meeting and some of my own insights.

If the\nstring starts without an alphanumeric character, I iterate through the element until I find an alphanumeric character and then append\nthat to the abbreviation array.\n\nIt works for something like: \u2018The Road __Not__ Taken\u2019 where the output is \u2018TRNT\u2019\nBut it doesn\u2019t work where non-alphanumeric characters are within the string like: \u2018Complementary metal-oxide semiconductor\u2019 which expects --&gt; \u2018CMOS\u2019```\ndef abbreviate(words):\n\n    words_array = words.split(' ')\n\n    abbreviation = list()\n\n    for word in words_array:\n\n        index_counter = 0\n\n        if word[0].isalnum():\n            abbreviation.append((word[0]).upper())\n            pass\n        else:\n            while word[index_counter].isalnum() == False:\n                index_counter += 1\n                if word[index_counter].isalnum():\n                    abbreviation.append((word[index_counter]).upper())\n\n    return ''.join(abbreviation)\n\n\nwords = 'The Road _Not_ Taken'\n# Complementary metal-oxide semiconductor, 'CMOS'\n# words = 'Complementary metal-oxide semiconductor'\n\n\ndef test(words):\n    print(abbreviate(words))\ntest(words)\n```What did you try?Does anyone have an idea on how to split a string using multiple delimiters without using regex?I was thinking of reshifting my focus to be able to clearly articulate all the works of OOP and walk through examples like the one you proposed, and then go into that other stuffI'll give that a shot <@Noah Woodward> judging by what I was told the interview would be a about, you think I should still be hammering down string manipulatioon, array manipulation, sorting algorithms, and going over a little of the other data structures(hash maps, linked lists, trees, stacks, dequeues, etc.) I know it's hard to say, I'm just trying to gauge how i should best spend my time before Monday morningAn interesting OOP challenge that I often think is a good idea to tackle is using OOP, design a bowling game application.

Next 5 minutes I implemented the solution, which didn't initially work at first. I then talked her through the problem that I was having, how i'd fix it, and then actually fixed it. That took approx another 5 minutes. The last ten minutes were spent solving and talking about the last problemI had about 30 minutes to solve both problems<@Nathan Pillai>so the `sent_most_love()` and the `received_most_love()` function should essentially be the same. The thing that I saw that differed from your solution to mine, was that I didn't zip the values and keys together, instead, I used `sorted(employee_dict, key=lambda item: item[1], reversed=True)` to give me a list of employees sorted in order based on most love either sent or received.<@Vincenzo Marcella> How did you go about solving the problem and what was your time limit? I took a stab at the problem and would appreciate any help in improving my solution. I feel like there is definitely a more DRY solution.yes <@Nathan Pillai>Thanks <@Vincenzo Marcella> for sharing the question. Can we assume that love_sent will always contain positive feedback objects?Python 3! <@Asim Zaidi>Nice! What language did you choose to solve it in?Today I interviewed with Yelp, here is the format of the interview for anyone interested:\n```\n1. Interviewer talked about themselves, their position, and what they do at work\n2. Interviewer asked me about a project I recently worked on, what problems I faced during it, and how I overcame those problems.\n3. Interviewer then prompted me with the technical questions.\n```\n\nQuestion 1\nYelp wants to keep track of positive feedback or \"love\" from employees given to other employees. The data looks as follows:\n```\n[\n    {\n        \"receiver\": \"<mailto:amy@yelp.com|amy@yelp.com>\",\n        \"message\": \"They helped me get unblocked\"\n        \"sender\": \"<mailto:dorothy@yelp.com|dorothy@yelp.com>\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"receiver\": \"<mailto:bailey@yelp.com|bailey@yelp.com>\",\n        \"message\": \"They helped me get unblocked\"\n        \"sender\": \"<mailto:dorothy@yelp.com|dorothy@yelp.com>\"\n    },\n     {\n        \"receiver\": \"<mailto:dorothy@yelp.com|dorothy@yelp.com>\",\n        \"message\": \"They were a fun interviewer\"\n        \"sender\": \"<mailto:cenz@yelp.com|cenz@yelp.com>\"\n    },\n    ... (and so on)\n]\n```\nGiven this data, how would you return `k` number of employees that received the most love (positive feedback).\n\u2022 Assume that inputs `love_sent` is a list containing json objects or a dictionary and `k` is an integer specifying the amount of employees you'd like returned in the output\n\u2022 The output should be a list of strings containing the emails of `k` most loved employees.\n\nQuestion 2\nHow would you find `k` employees that sent the most love (positive feedback) on other employees\n\u2022 Same constraints for input and output as abovethe dotted zig zag lineFollow the arrows or the letters?Thanks everyone!

I prepared several days beforehand by reviewing my basic Python data structures and common algorithm challenges, as well as formalizing my understanding of data analysis techniques and packages in Python, including `Pandas`, `NumPy`, and `MatPlotLib`.\n\nThe interviewers were all engineers on the team I'd be joining and were very friendly and open to me. They weren't 'stonewall' interviewers with cold expressions and emotionless responses; rather, they were incredibly receptive to questions and approaches I was taking and even gave me impromptu feedback at many points.\n\nI had four interviewers who each asked me a single whiteboard question and a few behavioral questions in four 30-minute intervals, filling up the timespan of about two and a half (2.5) hours. Two questions were programmatic with a focus on data analysis and the specific role I was applying to (data filtering and cleaning an unstructured, raw dataset), one was programmatic with a basic look at my flexibility with Python, and one was a more abstract question challenging my knowledge of statistical testing and systems engineering.\n\nOverall, I found the questions to be not nearly as challenging as I expected, with the exception of the second data analysis question, which quite nearly stumped me entirely. Still, it was important that I kept my cool and worked through it with the interviewer rather than closing up and shutting down. I'll happily post a file with each question in detail along with my attempted solutions and process.Aakash's Solutions to Apple Recruitment Python Challenges*(part 2)*\nThe first critical checkpoint of the interview process was a series of phone screening a couple of weeks back. The first was purely behavioral with one of the members of the team I'd be joining. The second was a little more programmatic, where they assessed my knowledge of basic Python. One question I remember (unfortunately I didn't write down many questions from then) was _what the difference is between a list, set, and tuple in Python_. Definitely necessary to know Python's usefulness pretty well.\n\nI had a coding challenge to do within 24 hours comprised of four questions. The question prompt is below, and my responses are attached as a file (feel free to take a look and send me any feedback/questions you have). Their primary feedback was positive, particularly highlighting my focus on clear and descriptive comments and drive towards code encapsulation.\n\n&gt;Given the following python list of strings:\n\n&gt;TASKLIST = ['work,0650,0730',\n&gt;'read,1100,1115',\n&gt;'play,1210,1250',\n&gt;'read,1515,1530',\n&gt;'eat,1130,1430',\n&gt;'run,1750,1930',\n&gt;'eat,2000,2100',\n&gt;'play,1800,2100']\n\n\n&gt;#1.

I'll spare no effort to describe details - all that's left from my end is the final result of whether they wanna hire me or not!\n\n*(part 1)*\nAll in all, the process went pretty well! From the moment <@Duncan MacDonald> reached out to me about the potential to interview at Apple for a Data Analyst position, I was a little skeptical of my ability to match up to these standard, but at this point I'm pretty excited and grateful for making it this far.\n\nI primarily worked through a recruiter of TEKsystems (big recruiting firm that sources talent to major tech companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft, etc.) in scaling up for this assessment. She helped me tremendously with interview prepping and understanding the dimensions of the role.Hey all, gonna post sometime today a lengthy post regarding my data analyst interview at Apple! What went right, what went wrong, how I prepped, types of questions, etc. \n\nTl;dr, went much better than expected. Questions weren't overly challenging but did push me to explain thoroughly yet concisely. Interviewers were pleasant and very helpful. Questions spanned my understanding of programming, data analysis, statistics, and systems design.<@Vincenzo Marcella> has joined the channelPDF of _Cracking the Coding Interview_: <http://plusteach.com/digbooks/b_img/three.pdf>Jeremy shared this in <#C2DA91MNY|resources>: <https://www.dailycodingproblem.com><@Maximo Hinojosa> has joined the channel<@Erick (Wesley) Espinoza> has joined the channelThats incredible dude I would wish you luck but I doubt you\u2019ll need itGood luck <@Aakash (Kash) Sudhakar>!!!<@Jeremy James> has joined the channel<@Asim Zaidi> has joined the channel<@KJ Wilson> has joined the channel<@Jasmine Humbert> has joined the channel<@Ebonne Cabarrus> has joined the channelGood luck!Eyyyy good luck dudeGood Luck man <@Aakash (Kash) Sudhakar> You got this Ka$h <@Aakash (Kash) Sudhakar>Hey folks, I have an interview for a Data Analyst position at Apple tomorrow afternoon.

Some companies do have online coding challenges, but I think white-boarding will help us cover both interview types.<https://leetcode.com/>\n\nRecommended by a friend yesterday. Perfect for beginners. I will be doing one a day, starting off with Two Sum.\n\n<https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/>\n\nI will post my results on this challenge in a thread tomorrow. I invite you to do the same, and we can comment on each other's solutions. Feel free to take 1 to 3 days to get to this at your own leisure.\n\nFor the most part, I believe this club will be used as a channel to talk about different types of coding challenges, as well as a place for sharing resources. But that's also up to all of you.\n\nTo conclude, can we do a quick poll?\n\nWho is interested in doing challenges like this a few times a week, to complete in your own time and post your results here?

So this week we will be holding another session on thursday after product class ~5:30!  Looking forward to seeing you all there :slightly_smiling_face:Ok right now the tentative plan is to do this club on Thursdays because it will be after Wednesday core so people could continue working on problems from there or go more in depth during the club :thumbsup: \n\nBut lets have a vote to be sure that this works for more people than not....\n\nGiven the option of having this club on Tuesday or Thursday - which would you prefer? React with a :whale: for tuesdays and a :ghost: for ThursdaysHey we are going to make a google doc for all of the problems!  But for now - the two problems from last week:\n\n1. Given a list of integers return the min and max integer \n2. Given a list of integers and a sum K find a pair of integers that sum to K.Chiming in with a vote: 1st choice Tuesday, 2nd for Thursdays :slightly_smiling_face:<@Gian Franco Vitola> has joined the channelOne of those cool ones with emojis that Alan does.You should hold a vote <@Alex Dejeu>.Either works for me.<@Julia Geist> I think a candidate for writing club is thursday - couldn\u2019t we keep doing tuesdays though?I think this was solid. I think the pairs role play is key. If we have enough sample questions to go over with someone and practice, that to me is the best experience. Thought you guys did a great job leading the group. \n\nAlso, thanks for trying to accommodate the drone club. Thursdays work for me. <@Alex Dejeu> when is our writing club running? I think a candidate for our set day of the week was Thurs?Further, two questions:\n\n*1:* How did people like the format from last week?  Should we do something similar again this week?  Ex:  We do one problem as an entire group and then break off to do problems individually.  If you like this format react with a :seedling: and if you think we could do something different react with a :doge: and provide the alternative!\n\n*2:*  We are going to be moving this club from Wednesdays to another day so it does not interfere with drone club :fire: I am currently thinking Thursday, but that is available to change.  Let me know if Thursdays do not work for you!  It would be after product class (5:30) and run for around 60 to 90 minutes depending how long people want to stay :slightly_smiling_face:Hello Hello Everyone!

I am here to talk about Amazon Web Services (AWS)! If you don't know what AWS is, it's basically a place to host stuff like servers, databases, websites, images, and much much more (Check out Elastic Beanstalk, it's amazing). They have something for everything you might need. \n\nWhy I'm preaching AWS so much? It's because they have a free tier that gives you free hosting for a year! If you need to host a website, or server you can do it for a year for free! But the hosting is limited to their lowest tier (still really fast). \n\nIf you are like me, and already used up the free tier. Amazon offers a program, AWS Activate,  for Startups that gives you amazing perks! If you get into this program they give you $1,000 worth of credits, business and technical training ($800 evaluation each), and 80 credits to their self paced lab. They also have cool things like the AWS Loft that is a place you can go to and talk to Amazon Engineers and work in their co-working space. I highly recommend applying for this service BUT only if you already did the free trial (or you need better servers). You need to have some specific things to qualify for this (an example is a working company website and email domain).\n\nIf you want some more information on AWS or if you would like to checkout the AWS Loft with me (it's a block away), feel free to get in touch with me.  \n \nAWS Free Tier: <https://aws.amazon.com/free/>\nAWS Activate: <https://aws.amazon.com/activate/><https://medium.freecodecamp.org/heres-a-new-way-to-learn-coding-tools-and-concepts-right-when-you-need-them-ee82d15c576d?source=linkShare-e5c758c4af8d-1506150710><https://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-SF/events/243289055/?rv=me2&amp;https=on><https://robots.thoughtbot.com/the-vim-learning-curve-is-a-myth>issa movement<@Rohan Mishra> has joined the channelI saw that video before. It's really cool!!<https://strangeparts.com/how-i-made-my-own-iphone-in-china/><@Megan Doepker [Marketing]> has joined the channelEverything about the notch screams horrible design. Creating a rounded corner display is a decent thought but the notch makes all of it pointless and violates the central pillar of design and one that Apple pioneered... \"form follows function\". Here function follows form as the only reason they have to include the notch is because they want the form of the screen to be flush with the edge of the phone therefore requiring a notch to be present or the camera and proximity sensor. It's the ultimate tell that you're building something to look cool first and functional second. \n\nTo top it off they released iPhone X at the same time they released iPhone 8. Following suit with Microsoft's horrible version convention of jumping from Windows 8 to windows 10. Except this is worse since they are releasing both at the same time. \n\nWhether the device is actually worthwhile or not is irrelevant. Examples like this and iMessage stickers (in the last update) show that business people are calling the shots and the designers that once made up the Potala Palace of design have now been exiled to another country.Problem is that the screen corners and notch will not be the same on the next device, and the next, etc. Dealing with a variable resolution and aspect ratio is already a pain for iPads/iPhones. If we were out of screen space I\u2019d agree more but a 6+, 7+ or 8+ with 1080x1920 (fully HD on a phone !!!!) is already plenty. My 60 inch TV is only 1920x1080, so resolution is not the problem. If the X were a lot bigger than the 8 plus I might be interested. The should bring back the headphone jack. I am sticking with my 6+ 128gb for a while longer.I might be in the minority, however I think it is actually pretty elegant. It allows for extra screen space that was once unused. The battery life, time and wifi info can now shift up, giving more white space above the top row of icons.I\u2019m with you on that one Shannon. I think the design is just stupid. It\u2019s going to make it harder on iOS devs because it isn\u2019t just one more screen size to support, it\u2019s also a whacky screen shape that we have to support now too.Idiotic to have a notch at the top of the screen.

The good news is that there are resources to explain what to do here, and elsewhere, including instructions on how to protect yourself, prevent yourself from being a victim in the future, and how to potentially profit from the blatant negligence of the credit cabal. I highly suggest reading this whole article and following through on everything here.

That\u2019s because paired teams have less \u201cworking units\u201d than teams of solos. Imagine that in a team of 6 one unit has some issues that stall the work. For pairs it will mean that 2 people are setting back and 66% of their team continues the work in normal time. Solos will have about 84% in the same situation. Now imagine 2 units out. The difference will be even greater. Pairs will have only 33% of people that will do the tasks while solos will have twice the strength.&gt;Our experiment confirmed that pairs write code slower but with better quality. Although the differences were not as big as previous tests claimed them to be.

Problem is, it is an outdated version, so during the summer academy, we had some problems caused by an old git version, which is quite hard to debug  -&gt; 'action failed' . So in order to use a more recent version, make sure you have homebrew installed, run `brew update` followed by `brew install git`. Now, you have git installed in the homebrew directory, but the preinstalled version still takes precedence over the new one. To fix that, open your .rc file (.bashrc, .zshrc etc) in your home directory, and at the bottom, add `export PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:$PATH`  , save and restart your terminal.

Is the event listener added each time the attack dialog box is opened?\n2. If so you'll need to remove it each time it is closed. Otherwise you'll be increasing the number of listeners by 1 each time you click the button.\n3.

Imagine each class you define in it's own file.\n\nDo this by moving the MyClass code into a new file inside the src directory. I named the new file my-scene.js. There three changes, find them. Line 1 imports Scene from phaser.  Line 3 uses Scene rather than Phaser.Scene, due to the previous change, the last line exports this class, this allows you to import the class.\n\n```import { Scene } from 'phaser'\n\nclass MyScene extends Scene {\n    constructor() {\n        super()\n\n        this.myVar = 99\n    }\n\n    preload() {\n        this.load.image('logo', 'assets/Alien-1_1.png');\n    }\n\n    create() {\n        var logo = this.add.image(200, 150, 'logo');\n\n        this.tweens.add({\n            targets: logo,\n            y: 350,\n            duration: 2000,\n            ease: 'Power2',\n            yoyo: true,\n            loop: -1\n        });\n    }\n}\n\nexport default MyScene```\n\nNow change index.js. Here you will modify the import statement at the top. To import Game from Phaser, this allows you to change the last line to new Game rather than new Phaser.Game. Also, you'll import your MyClass that you exported in the my-class.js file on line 2.\n\n```import { Game } from 'phaser';\nimport MyScene from './my-scene'\n\nvar config = {\n    type: Phaser.AUTO,\n    parent: 'phaser-example',\n    width: 400,\n    height: 400,\n    scene: new MyScene()\n};\n\nvar game = new Game(config);```Notes from class. Extend Phaser.Scene to create a Scene. The original code showing the functions that were used to build the scene are in a comment at the bottom.\n\nLook closely at the config object to see the changes here where a new scene is created from the new MyScene Class.\n\n```import 'phaser';\n\nclass MyScene extends Phaser.Scene {\n    constructor() {\n        super()\n\n        this.myVar = 99\n    }\n\n    preload() {\n        this.load.image('logo', 'assets/Alien-1_1.png');\n    }\n\n    create() {\n        var logo = this.add.image(200, 150, 'logo');\n\n        this.tweens.add({\n            targets: logo,\n            y: 350,\n            duration: 2000,\n            ease: 'Power2',\n            yoyo: true,\n            loop: -1\n        });\n    }\n}\n\nvar config = {\n    type: Phaser.AUTO,\n    parent: 'phaser-example',\n    width: 400,\n    height: 400,\n    scene: new MyScene()\n};\n\nvar game = new Phaser.Game(config);\n\n// function preload ()\n// {\n//     this.load.image('logo', 'assets/Alien-1_1.png');\n// }\n\n// function create ()\n// {\n//     var logo = this.add.image(400, 150, 'logo');\n\n//     this.tweens.add({\n//         targets: logo,\n//         y: 450,\n//         duration: 2000,\n//         ease: 'Power2',\n//         yoyo: true,\n//         loop: -1\n//     });\n\n// }```<https://www.valentinog.com/blog/webpack-tutorial/><http://labs.phaser.io/index.html><https://github.com/soggybag/phaser3-project-template>Whoa this is sick - good resource!also for transforms:\n<https://codepen.io/vineethtr/pen/XKKEgM>I know this is from last term but I found this code-pen that really helps refresh flexbox:\n\n<https://codepen.io/enxaneta/pen/adLPwv>Yep! :smile:wait, TODAY?:white_check_mark: Poll successfully deleted.That is not an acceptable excuse.

While your work may differ from what have made  you ca use the solution for comparison.\n\n<https://github.com/Product-College-Courses/FEW-1.2-JavaScript-Foundations/tree/master/solutions/oregon-trail>Here is a solution for the Breakout game. Consider this a baseline solution for the OOP challenges. You can use this as a reference. Feel free to implement these ideas in your own work. You can borrow from this.\n\n<https://github.com/Product-College-Courses/FEW-1.2-JavaScript-Foundations/blob/master/solutions/breakout/index.html>This seems to say the capture phase while rarely used happens first! This would make sense. The event would work it's way down (outside in) to the target element, then bubble back up.\n\nSeems like this makes sense an event. you'd want want the target to have the first crack at handling an event. Then pass it on via bubbling to it's ancestors.\n\nCapturing can be ignored. There are probably fewer situations where an ancestor would need an event first before the target.\n\nThat said the event has a target property, and you can use this to identify the target. This would allow an ancestor react based on what the target is.Not totally how all browsers handle this.\n\nThat said I think bubbling is the more common model. If I understand correctly, when an event occurs at an element, that element handles the event, then passes the event to it's parent and the process repeats. you could say the event bubbles up.\n\nYou stop events from propagating by calling stopPropagation() on the event.\n\nI thought bubbling was the the system, and there was an option to specify otherwise when the event was created, or was it that events bubbled up first than followed with a capture phase where events worked their way back down?\n\nThis article seems to explain it pretty good. Seems to say:\n\n&gt; There\u2019s another phase of event processing called \u201ccapturing\u201d. It is rarely used in real code, but sometimes can be useful.\n\n<https://javascript.info/bubbling-and-capturing><@Mitchell Hudson [FEW]> I was reading up on event handling (capturing vs bubbling). I found a source that said some browsers are split between the two.  Was what I was reading legacy? It seems like bubbling is the go to for all browsers now.<!channel> We may be having a break, but I will be having afternoon office hours Mon, Wed, Fri this week from 1pm-5pm at Vantaggio's Common areaOffice hours for FEW students will be MW from 1:30-5 and on request as needed <!channel>^ The link that we\u2019re supposed to be following<https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/javascript/>Hello everyone,\nGoing forward <@Mitchell Hudson [FEW]> and I will be reviewing your code,  and filing issues in your Github on a project by project basis to help you all grow as developers and to check your progress in the course.\nThank you<!channel> I noticed a few people did not return after the break yesterday.

If you\u2019re animating the element anyway maybe it doesn\u2019t need the problematic rule?\n\nTry using a more specific selector. Selectors with more specificity over rule less specific selectors.

I am building a chatroom application where users can create different chatrooms and message people (very similar to slack now that I think about it), however the problem is when the user leaves the chatroom the room is erased. I wanted to persist the chatroom or the messages in it ... that's where I am hesistant to make a decision. I don't know what the most efficient way is to go about persisting these channels. A couple ways I was thinking was save the room along with an id and other information in a mongo db then save some of the most recent messages in memory. Or use an external service to store it in memory. Apologies for the rant but any input would be great!

Also if you get an error like $ is not defined or .ajax is not a function, it's because your posts.js file is dependent on the jquery and ajax scripts so you have to include them first before you include the posts.js scriptGood looking out!<https://twitter.com/sehurlburt/status/1071508890611666945> Worth posting your articles in this threadI was summoned? <@Novan (Donny) Adams> has joined the channelDoesn't <@Novan (Donny) Adams> have tutoring on the weekends?? :smirk:I know we\u2019re all busy with finishing projects etc. I would like to offer lunch to someone this weekend to either  tutor me in person or maybe just screen share on slack.

Confused :confused:Feel free to message me. Remember, it's not your fault, it's Javascript's.That is strange behavior, but I think having an array of the schema of the Comment is much different.\n\nI believe the Comments would be embedded in the Post\u2019s model rather than having references to Comment\u2019s ObjectId.Trying to better understand error handling in JavaScript if anyone could possibly help me: Promise reject vs throw, having a tough time grasping it :confused:I wasn't able to view my comments on localhost after switching them to embedded in my Post model. \n\nAfter I created a new post, I was able to view them there once again without changing any code What exactly was the issue you were having? My code seemed to work just fine.Just a heads up for people doing comments on comments (step 11)\nWhen you get to this part:\n```\nconst Comment = require(\"../models/comment\");\n...\nconst PostSchema = new Schema({\n\tcomments: [Comment.schema],\n\t// comments: [{\n\t// \ttype: Schema.Types.ObjectId,\n\t// \tref: Comment\n\t// }],\n```\nremember that your old posts will not have the new model structure \u2014 meaning that the comments that your old posts have will no longer display. You will still be able to add comments to your post, but won\u2019t be able to see them.\n\nhowever, your new posts will have the new model structure \u2014 meaning that any comments that you add will display.\n\nThis was blocking me for a good amount of time; I was thinking it was a bug, when all I needed to do was make a new post to test!good idea!Thanks for tip :slightly_smiling_face:Cool beans. I am thinking that when I demo at open house I might do that and then have a sticky note with the \u201cdemo user\u201d credentialsI usually just show products with a \"demo user\" already in place in the DB, created with typical sign up form. Otherwise, too much hard coding required. :+1:<@Dani Roxberry [BEW]> If we are demoing/showing off our projects in a public format, would it be inappropriate for us to create a demo user and render it into our login template?\nEx:\n`Welcome to the landing page.

Setting view engine will only work if you use express router to render the templates.

Authorization is whether you have a key to a master suite or a common room<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3llBqByNOUk>Authentication: logging in and having an account. Authorization: whether you are a member, dev, or admin and which resources that gives you access to.Authentication permits you to access an entire website. Authorization requires you to be a specific user to access specific resources.When I go inside an airport I need to show my id for authentication. I will need authorization to enter the cockpitAuthentication is checking if you are who you say you are. Authorization is giving them access to something if they are allowed to.Authentication is when Belmont recognizes that the demon before him is Dracula, who steals men\u2019s souls. Authorization is when Belmont says \u201cDie monster! You don\u2019t belong in this world!\u201d i.e. indicating he is unauthorized here in the mortal realmAuthentication uses the username and password to prove who you are and returns a Token, which you can use for Authorization (grants you access to resources)Authentication is like using your newly issued make school ID to prove that you\u2019re a student, while Authorization is using your make school ID to determine what kinds of rooms you have access to.Authenticantion is the permission that proves your identity to let you in.\nAuthorization is given your identity what is the level of trust that you have to access certain types of information.Entering Vantaggio you must be authenticated for you need a key to enter the building anyone who lives at vantaggio can do so! However, rooms are limited to only authenticated personnel for example Matthew and Mathias can enter the building but only I am authorized to enter my room!Authentication makes sure that you are who you say you are. Authorization gives you access to your information after its been proven who you are.Authentication is the use of credentials to verify the identity of a user, and authorization is what you allow that user to do in the system after they are authenticated.Authentication revolves around validating credentials (user/pass) in order to verify one\u2019s identity. Authorization occurs when your identity is successfully authenticated, thus giving full access to the user.Authentication refers proving a user\u2019s relative \u201csecurity\u201d level. I in most cases there will only be two levels, `Logged In` or `Not Logged In` (although there is wiggle room to add additional security levels, ex: Admins or Super Admins)\nAuthorization refers to the increased (or decreased) amount of functionality available to a user based on their Authentication. Different authentication levels can create a variety of authorization combos for usersAuthentication is the process of gaining authorizations. Authorization is when you already know who someone is and you check to see if they can do things. Like if you go to a concert and the bouncer first checks if you have a ticket (authentication), then checks if you are over 21 and if so gives you a stamp on your hand that tells the bar that you are allowed to drink (authorization).Authentication connects a session to a user, Authorization makes sure a user can access a piece of data<https://github.com/Product-College-Courses/BEW-1.2-Authentication-and-Associations/tree/master/10-Authorization>Reminder: update your attendence please! <https://make.sc/trackbew1.2>Authentication is proving you're not a replicant. Authorization is being made a Replicant Hunter.Authentication is does your name match your ID authorization is do you have the privilege to drive a car or motorcycle endorsement.`&lt;div class=\"{{ if not currentUser}}un{{endif}}authenticated\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;` :smile:<http://expressjs.com/en/api.html#res.locals>\nvs\n<http://expressjs.com/en/api.html#app.locals>Authentication: When you are asked for ID at the bar.\nAuthorization: If you\u2019re old enough to drink.Authentication is being able to unlock your iPhone  using your passcode/face/finger and authorization is being able to open up/use any app you want .Authentication: User credentials to login to Facebook account\nAuthorization: Have the ability to join friend groups, make posts, comment, etcAuthentication is verifying you can see the project tracker and authorization is making sure that user has the right access to edit that project trackerAuthentication &gt;&gt; User: I am Neo &gt;&gt;&gt; Matrix: Yes you are! / No you are Agent!\nAuthorization &gt;&gt; User: I am Neo &gt;&gt;&gt; Matrix: Yes you are! (Authenticated) &gt;&gt;&gt; Matrix: Welcome to Matrix!authentication is verifying your date looks like their profile\nauthorization is seeing if youre getting luckyAuthentication - ID card to enter the university\nAuthorization - what resources are allowed based on the ID of the person. if it is a staff ID they are authorized to go to staff room etc.A example of Authentication is like going to an a event and a security guard checks to see if your name is on a list.\nAuthorization is being on the list but also having permission to go into a VIP section of an event.Authentication is like being invited to someone\u2019s house and meeting the host at the door to verify your identity. Authorization is like having permission to visit only certain rooms in the house so to be respectful to your hosts.Authentication is verifying wether or not a user has access to a system.\nAuthorization makes sure that a user has access to the resources they are requesting on the system they authenticated in.The question we ask with *authentication*: \u201d _Are you who you say you are??_\u201d\n\nThe question we ask with *authorization* \u201d _What are you allowed to do, as a user of the group you\u2019ve just logged into?\u201c_The authentication process comes first where your credentials like username and password are verified. Second is the authorization process that verifies whether you can obtain access to certain parts of the website.\n_Therefore, a user can be authenticated and not have full authorization._Authentication is like verifying someone to enter an office. It happens upon entry and allows them access to the building. Authorization however takes place after the user has entered the building. It relates to which floors(pages) the user is allowed to visit based on the authentication.You must be *Authentication* to enter a CIA building.\n\nYou must be *Authorized* to enter any top secret room in that building, or view any top secret documents<https://github.com/Product-College-Courses/BEW-1.2-Authentication-and-Associations/tree/master/10-Authorization>testing is 90% of the battleI just figured out this neat trick for sending emails to new users with their api key.

Think of it like a profile the user can use like a dashboard you built on rotten potatoes to be able to delete/ edit/ view posts and comments Don\u2019t use those  test. They aren\u2019t effective. Highly confused at Page 9 Auth Testing Sign up - why are we doing User.findOneAndRemove before the agent postso 1 is a link to /users/:username route if I understand correct? And their profile will show their basic info and their posts and comments.\n\n/profile will be the same deal but it's specific to the logged in user, right\n\nand users/:username/comments will show you a users info + only their comments\n\nin that case we should also make a /profile/comments route for the logged in user as well i think1. Can you make an author's username a link that displays that users's profile at /users/:username?\n2 .Can you do the same for comments?\n3. Can you make a /profile route that loads the current user and displays their posts and comments?Hey on page 8 of Reddit Clone Stretch Challenges, I wasn't sure how to differentiate 1 and 3?`brew cask install insomnia`Everyone working on your API project check this out: <https://insomnia.rest/>Not a helpful responseDon't reinvent the wheel.So in my node app certain views need to use different footer partials, so the cunundrum i'm running into is having to specify which footer partial to use within my  page's view, but it doesn't seem very semantic having to keep doing it this way. Also, some pages require some js files, i wouldn't like that script to be loaded into the main for every page, but at the same time i'd like to keep my web applications structure fluent.. any thoughts on how to handle this? Sorry if it doesn't make much sense, I'll include a screen shot of my main partial.

I'm having trouble with a loop in my SPD project.In 2010, Ecma International started developing a standards test for Ecma 262 ECMAScript.[35] Test262 is an ECMAScript conformance test suite that can be used to check how closely a JavaScript implementation follows the ECMAScript 5th Edition Specification. The test suite contains thousands of individual tests, each of which tests some specific requirements of the ECMAScript specification.\n\nDevelopment of test262 is a project of Ecma Technical Committee 39 (TC39). The testing framework and individual tests are created by member organizations of TC39 and contributed to Ecma for use in Test262.\n\nImportant contributions were made by Google (Sputnik testsuite) and Microsoft who both contributed thousands of tests. The Test262 testsuite already contains more than 11,000 tests and is being developed further as of 2013.\n\nECMAScript specifications through ES7 are well-supported in major web browsers. The table below shows the conformance rate for current versions of software with respect to the most recent editions of ECMAScript.\n\n```\nScripting engine\tReference application(s)\t\t\t\tES5[37]\t\tES6[38]\t\tES7[39]\t\tNewer (2016+)[39][40]\nChakra\t\t\tMicrosoft Edge 18\t\t\t\t\t100%\t\t96%\t\t100%\t\t58%\nSpiderMonkey\tFirefox 63\t\t\t\t\t\t\t100%\t\t98%\t\t100%\t\t78%\nChrome V8\t\tChrome 70, Opera 57\t\t\t\t\t100%\t\t98%\t\t100%\t\t100%\nCore (Nitro)\t\tSafari 12\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t99%\t\t99%\t\t100%\t\t90%\n```This is what i use to quickly generate a node express app - <https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html><@Jasmine Humbert> ^^^<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34259248/what-if-jwt-is-stolen>Reminder: update your attendence please! <https://make.sc/trackbew1.2><@Jayce Azua> has joined the channel<https://medium.com/@maison.moa/using-jwt-json-web-tokens-to-authorize-users-and-protect-api-routes-3e04a1453c3e> :raised_hands:<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch>```\nvar url = '/sign-in';\nvar data = {username: 'example', password: 'hihihi'};\n\nfetch(url, {\n  method: 'POST', // or 'PUT'\n  body: JSON.stringify(data), // data can be `string` or {object}!\n  headers:{\n    'Content-Type': 'application/json'\n  }\n}).then(res =&gt; res.json())\n.then(response =&gt; console.log('Success:', JSON.stringify(response)))\n.catch(error =&gt; console.error('Error:', error));\n```<https://auth0.com/docs/security/store-tokens><https://github.com/Product-College-Courses/BEW-1.2-Authentication-and-Associations/tree/master/08-Authentication-Sessions-vs-JWT#challenges-75-minutes><https://github.com/Product-College-Courses/BEW-1.2-Authentication-and-Associations/tree/master/08-Authentication-Sessions-vs-JWT>I can help you but I am in class right now.

For example, logging into a website using a password. Knowing the password, authenticates that you are the owner of the account.\n\nAuthorization checks if you have access to certain files or actions within the app. For example, editing a Reddit post. If you are the author of the post, you are authorized to edit the post. Otherwise, you do not have access to editing the post.Authentication verifies who you are usually via a username and password and allows you to enter a system. Authorization comes after authentication and determines which resources you have a right to access.Authentication essentially verifies you are who you say you are. Authorization verifies you, an authenticated/verified person, are allowed to see something/be somewhere, like a profile section of the siteAuthentication: means that your credentials have been verified. Example is your username and password have been verified as correct and matching what we have in the database.\n\nAuthorization: is more related to the roles and access you have. Example, if you are a user of an app, you should not have authorization to an admin portal where you can see other user\u2019s data.Authentication - you are allowed into the club because your ID passes and says it is you.\n\nAuthorization - you are allowed in the general admission area but not in the VIP.<https://github.com/Product-College-Courses/BEW-1.2-Authentication-and-Associations/blob/master/10-Authorization/README.md>passport-tutoriarest up and feel better joe!!I won\u2019t be coming in today.

For example, taking the reddit clone as inspiration, if you want to know how many comments are on a post, instead of getting all the comments and reading the array length, you would store a value like \"comments_count\" inside the post's model. Eliminating the need to join the comments to get the comment count.*Pre-Aggregate Data*\nIf you find you are forming groups of data in a lot of application queries, you might want to consider pre-grouping, otherwise called aggregating.\n\n*Example*: If you want to know how many hits you get on your web page, you can implement a page counter instead of counting up all the users who visit your page.*Avoid :no_entry: Growing :chart_with_upwards_trend: Documents*:\nPre-allocate your data so you don't have negative impact :heavy_minus_sign: on your disk :cd: and DB :evergreen_tree: performance.\n-\nBy *pre-allocation*, we mean to _save space_ before hand :hand:. It's like _budgeting_ your space :stars:.\n-\n*Avoid :no_entry_sign: Updating Whole Documents*:\nOpt for in place updates in your documents :page_facing_up: instead of updating the entire document.

What's in it?*\n- A small piece of information conveyed in bits, about 1500 bytes/characters or a text message, but more are used for web pages\n- Used to send information over the internet\n- Have wrappers consisting of headers and trailers that indicate the start and end of a packet\n\n\n*How do TCP and UDP work?*\n- TCP is the most commonly used protocol on the internet. It is to control the transfer of data that is the most reliable.\n- TCP labeled its packet, make sure they have a deadline of which they have to arrive at their destination by. \n- For each packet received, the sender is notified with a packet of acknowledgement. \n- If no packet is received, then the protocol sends another copy of the missing or delayed packet so all packet are in order and there is no gap within the data stream.\n\n- In UDP the sender just keeps sending the packets, regardless of whether or not a packet is received or not\n- The protocol does not allow the receiver to ask for missing packets in the same datastream\n\n\n*What are the major differences?*\n- UDP are mostly use for unreliable, but quick, data streaming while TCP are used for reliable data transmission, that can delay seeing the final result.\n- UDP send packets but does not care if it does not get a response back. The key is for fast data transmission without delay as much as possible while TCP ensures that all packets are send in order and there is no packet missing or gap between data.\n\n\n*What is each protocol used for?*\n- TCP is used for receiving webpages, sending and receiving email, or any other types of data where all information matters, or time does not matter too much\n\n- UDP is used for network applications in which perceived latency is critical, such as in gaming and voice and video communications\n- UDP is suitable for purposes where error checking and correction are either not necessary or are performed in the application```<https://product-college-labs.github.io/Core-How-the-Internet-Works/Part1>*1.

For the first example, someone that tends to overthink or work themselves up for the smallest of issues may need something like a support system to handle stress. On the flip side of that, someone who doesn't tend to get worked up may only need thinking time by themselves. The one thing that one must be aware of when dealing with stress, is knowing when and when not to get worked up about something. From there you can make a plan of action on how to deal with the stressJeff is leading today.

I reached out to <@Alan Davis [CS]> to try and confirm (he is a workspace owner). \n\nIf I'm correct, we will need to build a web flow to enable any person to install Slackoverflow as a genuine Slack App. We'll have to make that leap sooner than expected because I don't think we'll be given perms to install the App ourselves. I think this should be our main consideration for the Sprint this week :ok_hand:Pushed the code for our demo today: <https://github.com/archproj/slackoverflow/tree/develop/server> - will fine tune and deploy after lunch, counting down the hours folks :tada::tada::tada:Yesterday I made further progress on slack events, but the wrapper we're using sucks, therefore...\n\nToday I'm going to deploy the `/ask` command, and will add the application to the MS Slack.\n\nBlockers: I'm broke, need to buy hosting and domain for Slackoverflow (been using heroku, if things don't work out we can stick with heroku)Reminder: :violin::violin::violin:Over the past few days I:\n- Moved from RTM to Events API\n- Refactored logic for RTM -&gt; Events\n\nToday:\n- I will finish the reimplementation of events and will deploy to the Slack\n\nNo blockersReminder: :violin::violin::violin:Awesome!

I tried to deploy a new build with an additional feature over the weekend and was having a weird issue with the method we were using to communicate with Slack, I've switched over to a different API and am rebuilding the comms.\n\nWe *will* launch this Friday, Lighting Talks are scheduled to happen, if they do not we have a backup plan in place.\n\nTo further encourage adoption we are:\n1. Going to make an announcement @ all hands/post in <#C1D3YFP6G|general> on Monday\n2. Have a Q&amp;A session on Wednesday\n3.

Just delays the ship to later in the day. We also plan to meet before that, and also will meet with <@Dani Roxberry [BEW]>. Will make an announcement in the channel when we are live.

But neither do I :sign_of_the_horns::skin-tone-5: :fire:Yesterday I finished the doc which I posted to the channel. I started porting the project to Golang, sounds like a risky maneuver this close to launch, but we have the logic for a functioning launch built into the Python server already.\n\nToday I will configure the Python server such that it is production ready. I'm doing a hackathon-type-thing this weekend to build this all in Golang in hopes of a few things:\n1. I can use it to fullfill requirements for the Golang class\n2. The hype around the language at Make School encourages some people to join the project\n3. I can talk to Dani about pitching this to the BEW class as a potential project they can join and work on\n4. Python makes web development unnecessarily complicated, especially when you need to do background tasks, whereas I can just use a keyword in Golang (the `go` keyword to start a `goroutine`) to essentially simulate this functionality.\n\nAdoption &gt;&gt; tech at this point so we need to do everything we can to have people use the tool and be willing to build things to expand Architect\n\nBlockers? nahReminder: :violin::violin::violin:<@Aakash (Kash) Sudhakar> <@Asim Zaidi> *important info about Phase-0*\n\nI spent the day really clarifying the docs so that we can all refresh and be clear on what is to be included in Phase-0's launch for our meeting tomorrow and so that the project thus far makes sense in the context of the rockeship for Architect.\n\nThe most important thing is this README (up until the Get Started section) as it clarifies Phase-0:\n&gt; <https://github.com/archproj/slackoverflow/tree/develop>\n\n*Through this process I discovered a very minimal version of <#CCKFVQ9V5|architect> that we can launch undoubtedly on the 15 because I have built all the functionality with the Demo version of the project.* I'll be working on rearchitecting the progress I've made such that the master branch has a pushed version of the project, that we can launch, by Monday. This will give us some breathing room for our launch date on the 15th.\n\nSome additional changes to note:\n1.

Check in time:\n\n\u2022 WHAT I DID YESTERDAY: Worked on some Python bot stuff yesterday (the questions and answers grabbed from Slack) whilst at Makey Makey. I shall push those changes today for y\u2019all to see. Puts it at about 10 questions that the bot can effectively recognize (10 questions with regex implementation for flexibility)\n\u2022 WHAT I\u2019LL DO TODAY: Push changes to Python bot and continue work on RegEx Q&amp;A.\n\u2022 BLOCKERS: Got a loooooooot of work on my plate so balancing everything is tricky, but so far it\u2019s doable.

Be sure to collaborate with the Make School admin if you want to demo it with the student body. Or go rouge and organize the demo yourself :grinning_face_with_one_large_and_one_small_eye:Hey <!channel>! Welcome to 2019! :confetti_ball: :chillparrot: Rohan and I welcome everyone back and would love to kickstart the year by continuing our progress into the _Architect project_ for any and all interested in pursuing our dream of decentralizing student activism within our little maker community! :fist::skin-tone-5: :make-school:\n\nI wanted to give a quick heads-up about the structure of how we'll be doing meetings and agile sprints throughout the next couple of months. We'll be implementing a structure of *two-week sprints*, with sprint-start meetings occurring on Mondays in-person while sprint retrospectives will occur the Thursday 10 days after the sprint start. :stopwatch: That way, it'll give ample time to work throughout the sprint and a couple of days between our retrospective and the next sprint. Throughout this time, we'll have progress check-ins and code reviews generally remotely, though in-person if it's necessitated. :computer: :calendar:\n\nWe have big goals for continuing the Architect project for this term, and now that we have v0 completed from our last SPD term :sports_medal: - our sights are high to pursue our goal of _implementing a basic version of Architect within Make School's Slack interface_ to better our communication and interactions within our little community. :star: :busts_in_silhouette: :dove_of_peace:Perhaps it's important to consider the negatives of employment in a firm as an individual as issues that Architect could potentially solve. The first thing that comes to mind is the fact that an employee can be let go unexpectedly for various reasons. Sometimes firm's aren't transparent (Google) or someone absues the power given to them. \n\nBtw I'm just using this as a place to jot down thoughts such that anyone can offer their own :ok_hand: Any input would be appreciatedYes! I'll work on it Monday.<@Aakash (Kash) Sudhakar> re-ping jicAs opposed to PayPal's system being an incentive system wherein it's employees are just mice rewarded for getting the cheese (interesting that apparently paying employees isn't enough), the employees could have greater say over internal operations or maybe even the future of the company - it's honestly difficult to define a great benefit to the individual (that Architect could provide) in a firm that the stakeholders of said firm would accept. The hardest part of installing our system is appeasing those whose power we are disintermediating through the installation.That's two systems that the general version of <#CCKFVQ9V5|architect> could improvesimilar to what we're building :eyes::eyes::eyes:<https://www.ccn.com/paypal-gets-into-blockchain-but-only-internally-among-employees-for-now/><@Asim Zaidi> has joined the channel<@Aakash (Kash) Sudhakar> are you interested in drafting the adoption plan for Wednesday?We scheduled a meeting for Wednesday next week at 10:00 AM to:\n&gt; 1.

Did some user interviews between last week and this week and I think that the angle we had for Phase 0 is reinforced by user feedback.Twitter thread:\n<https://twitter.com/natfriedman/status/1066823947436474369>HN thread:\n<https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18528365><https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/11/how-i-changed-the-law-with-a-github-pull-request/>Architect and the proposal system is early and certainly has a place<https://github.com/archproj/docs/projects/1>Git flow explained:\n<https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow>We did not meet today - I take responsibility for this. I should have sent out a Calendar invite for time/place of the meeting. I hope that our *meeting tomorrow, Thursday, during SPD (10:00 AM - 11:20) @ Make School* can be a stepping stone and assurance to you, <@Egon Fiedler>, <@Aakash (Kash) Sudhakar>, that we're moving in the right direction, thanks for your patience.\n\nWe need to rejuvenate our interest in the projects. Considering we're all extroverts (s/o megan but she's not in the channel), I do believe that can come from User Interviewing. As such, after the meeting, we'll kick it off with some interviews that are due at the EOD.Perfect thanks <@Aakash (Kash) Sudhakar>, how's that sound to you <@Egon Fiedler>?We can do that; don't mind my buddy visiting this week. I'll let him know that I have a quick chat in the morning before Make School tomorrow.How about 10 AM in the kitchenShoot, I'm busy this evening, can we shift it to first thing tomorrow morning? I can just send the resources/type of the content for the last Agenda bullet point tonight so we can skip that tomorrow morning.Milad has me doing tutorial work and I got training near then, can I sync up with y'all afterwards or later this evening? I'm betting I can be of some help with the Flask server.By Thursday, the goal is to:\n1. Have a *finalized the Phase-0 System Spec* - I'm working on this after resetting the Repo\n2. Have a *buildable blank slate Flask backend* with the required dependencies, frameworks, and tools (as finalized by the Spec)\n3. Meet w/ <@Dani Roxberry [BEW]> after we sync (this is a soft deadline, flexible based on Dani's availability + Phase-0 System Spec completion) to get a second look on the System Architecture\n\nEgon will begin work on this once I reset the Repo, he's working on aggregating the resources required right now: <https://github.com/archproj/make/issues/2>.\n\nThere are various tasks required to create the Phase-0 Boilerplate past what Egon will present today, we can best synergize by having you hop in and take those on with Egon. This is only possible after we all meet - we'll have multiple devs working on the same repo, we need to agree on best practices for managing. It also only makes sense to have multiple people working on the system after the Phase-0 Spec has been completed as the development work up until then does not require multiple people.\n\n<@Egon Fiedler> <@Aakash (Kash) Sudhakar> Would it be possible to meet today @ 4:30 until 5:05?\n*Agenda*\n&gt; 1. Egon's Presents his app Boilerplate (to be used for services in the system) - ~5 mins\n&gt; 2. We align on our understanding of User Stories -&gt; Phase 0 -&gt; Architect - ~25 mins\n&gt; 3. Agree on Gitflow/Issues - (repo management, why its important to do so for in a specific manner for Architect) ~ 5 minsWe will have a meeting today between the time frame of 3:30 to 5:30, <@Rohan Mishra> will post the time soon. Try to be at MS between those hours.Hey folks, just finished up with reading all the important docs and wireframing for the project. What can I be doing between today and Thursday?Hi,\n<@Rohan Mishra>, <@Aakash (Kash) Sudhakar>, would you be willing to have a meeting during the weekend to stablish a proper plan of action directed towards our current abilities and start seeing how we can frame that towards getting something that alines with Architect theoretical framework?By resources do you mean the theoretical framework behind Architect? I think the purpose of the meeting is more towards whether what we are building does classify has something that can be graded on and is on track with the purpose of the class. Because I\u2019m not really sure about many things that\u2019s why I was hoping to meet again before scheduling anything with <@Dani Roxberry [BEW]>, yesterday I was trying to place what you were saying on paper to be able to keep on track but we have not finished that yet because of time constraint, are you diagraming the plan?. An we need to have a plan of action with actionables framed towards our current strong points, because we need a polished product.perhaps we should aggregate the resources im building then send them to Dani with specific concerns, that way Dani can respond via Slack at her convienience or we can set up a meeting if required. Thoughts? <@Dani Roxberry [BEW]> <@Egon Fiedler> Thanks for the correction.our objectiveThanks a lot, we are not ready yet but our objective is that we have a plan to share with you by tonight.yaaas friends i will totally enable whatever you need as long as 3 things happen:\n\n- you're all present and on time for the meeting\n- you've created materials to support your requests\n- you've scheduled SPD support time with me via this link: <http://make.sc/dani-cal|make.sc/dani-cal>\n\ngracias!!Great to hear this, thanks for addressing my main concern and I\u2019m sure if we put ourselves really into this we might pull it of.Update 11/08/2018\nSprint 1\nMain Goals to Analyse\n- Every Thrusdays from now on to be on track we will fill a Rubricks Scheme, currently I own 4 copies with the respective date.\n- Today we have just done the Sprint1 Rubricks.\n- Got further on the user stories.\n- We have a Sprint Accountability worksheet, <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TFW-L7QvRq-1xsksnMc_1DeMonKWHsE37YKiQeKkzsg/edit>\n- Still missing a meeting with Dani, will plan more tonight before that.I think we are all capable of building everything, but given the time constraint I tried to mention what I understand has our main expertise, so we can know what are our current abilities. Regardless I\u2019m aware of how good of a developer you are and your capacity to solve issues in many areas once you are decided.To explain the lack of headway for the past couple of months (which may help dissolve Egon's frustration):\nMy neck slipped off my spine (and is *still* not back on it :grimacing:). I wake up and go to sleep in pain. The injury is just as bad as it sounds, but I don't emphasize it too much because instead of understanding I receive sympathy, which is not what I'm hoping for. It would be great if it was sympathy plus understanding, but my numerous conversations about the literal same things have shown me its just sympathy. Anyhow, as a result of this type of response and my own qualms about my conditions, Make School had been of little concern to me up until midway through October, when my conditioned improved after the doctors managed to pop my neck back in place.\n\nI've still felt mentally off since then despite a physical improvement (which has now come undone, neck popped back out again). I have come to the conclusion after a discussion with Dan that this has been the source of my in-action and lack of communication. I don't feel comfortable detailing the specifics of my mental health in this Slack channel. Just know that for me, awareness is the first step to dealing with an issue. I hope to prevent these issues from resurfacing, but in the future I will override any feelings of self-doubt and instead will communicate issues early if possible so that preventative actions can take place. I'll also be sure to mention everything I say or do in the place channel as well. Not to mention, this state of being is not the norm for my person, therefore I am very certain I can revert to being the lean mean coding machine I was.\n\n<@Egon Fiedler>,\nIn conclusion, if you could be clear about why you're bringing these issues up again then I may be able to address your frustration more specifically. I am guessing that it stems from your uncertainty about achieving a passing grade in SPD, which is the only new concern that I am able to see. Looking at the rubrics, I'm certain that we can finish a project that would earn you a passing grade given the deadline. Remember how Alan taught us to draw a picture for CS problems to avoid unnecessary/incorrect work? I've essentially been doing that, our path to completion will be a straight shot after you can see the picture I have attempted to draw in the README.\n\nThis all being said, you should check your tone when discussing issues like these. If I can do it, you can do it too.That link is finally working, got in touch with GitHub and they fixed a bug which apparently appeared as the culmination of several changes which have happened internally with the service in past couple weeks.\n\nIn the past week I've been working on specifics for how I believe we could approach acquiring users, which I'll have tonight. Here's the link again: <https://github.com/archproj/docs/tree/master/Make-School/README.md>\n\nI sense frustration in <@Egon Fiedler>'s message which is very understandable. The many things that Egon has detailed have all stemmed from my inability to fulfill my responsibilities as PM, as I see it. However, if my memory serves me correctly, I believe we had discussed all of these concerns verbally, so it is unclear to me the purpose of highlighting them here, after the fact. I would think a more direct line of communication regarding these issues would prove to be more beneficial for Egon as the only new information I have noticed appears to be a more specific case regarding him. However, that's only true because I think I have communicated my reasoning/communicated my reasoning well enough to him. Assuming that everything that Egon mentioned are observations he was previously unaware of, it seems that I have not been clear with my teammates in what little communication I have kept up regarding the project...\n\n1. Yes Architect will go through, I know because I'm putting/have been putting my 100% into the project, it has just been that my 100% now is at roughly like a 50%\n2. Sunny and Tia's status in the project remains unclear, however we can carry out the project without them. I reject your reductionist label of blockchain developer, as I'm pretty capable/willing to learn/can build anything required to get this project off the ground, further supporting that the project will go through\n3. Let's be practical for a moment, yes Architect will be completed but will it meet X arbitrary requirements by Y date so that you can get credits in the class? I'm not sure. I think it will, but the version of the project we will build to reach those requirements/that date are not even close to what I consider Architect. There is a version of the project which could meet that deadline/the requirements/ but still aligns with where Architect needs to eventually be, which is what I think we should consider pursuing. That being said, if you're working on this project for credits in the class, I have no qualms in saying perhaps you should consider leaving, just because who knows what'll happen<@Rohan Mishra> ^ Any thoughts? Please step up as PM.I think we must come with an MVP or something that does manage to satisfy this rubricks with every part at least Approaching Mastery.\n<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nd70y0jzxD31mgxvwxgXxUY_Bi4YAN_kX9To_M0UilI/edit>\n First we have to align what we actually can do, <@Aakash (Kash) Sudhakar> is a DataScientist, <@Rohan Mishra> a blockchain developer and myself kind of a iOS developer but mostly Backend. Is there anything we can do with our current abilities to have something done by December 13 that satisfy the rubricks, I\u2019m mostly interested on getting the credit for this class but if we are not getting that why even still bother to be on this class to sit by myself.\nThanks for taking your time reading this and I encourage every person that actually reads this to see the rubricks, have an actual meeting, get this together by the end of this week and have a meeting with DaniRoxberry to ensure we are on a track, time passes and I need to have something for my portfolio.From the current circunstances I know that the actual team members we got are <@Rohan Mishra>, <@Aakash (Kash) Sudhakar> and myself. I will assume <@Sunny Ouyang>  is out and that <@Tia (TJ) King> won\u2019t actually be involved much or at all (this asumptions are based on Sunny no longer even been part of SPD and Tia having an actual job that involves time) correct me if wrong.Hey, does Architect will actually go through? Right now I\u2019m in SPD and noone is here. I think we should take better advantage of this time in class or plan something out regarding what we will do has a team. The current roles of the team members and current circunstances.I will fix this as soon as I get a chance, not sure what is wrong, but first need to complete my Lightning TalkwtflolFinally completed<https://github.com/archproj/docs/tree/master/Make-School/README.md>Sounds great, thanks guys. I'll have the narrative doc today which we can use to build the user stories out, I'd love for you guys to share your thoughts on it once I drop it. From there we can video call on Monday for the start of our first Sprint, and during the interim period generate user stories/understand the concept/aggregate resources/start user interviewing for assumptions.We probably can put <@Sunny Ouyang> up to date through here and explain respective responsabilities. Probably <@Tia (TJ) King> can just talk it out straight with <@Rohan Mishra>, is this fine with you <@Rohan Mishra>?I'm good for whatever works best with everyone. If Rohanius is out-of-commission right now then let's work around his schedule to ensure synchronization. I'm also happy with hopping on a call anytime throughout the day if that works with folks.Given that I think no one is coming and to decrease <@Rohan Mishra> pressure because he is in pain and <@Aakash (Kash) Sudhakar> not make him come here for just one thing, let\u2019s have the meeting at night? I\u2019m the only one here.Should I get ready and head to Makey? I have no other classes or engagements today so was just gonna work from home but if we're meeting on-site, I can get ready quickly and head on over.I\u2019m here, is anyone else going to be here too?Also glad to be here folksAre we meeting today? If so, where and what time? Just pulled a little wakey uppey meself.welcome yung kashHi all, I'm gonna be late as a result of waking up in major pain.<@Aakash (Kash) Sudhakar> has joined the channelHey everyone, sorry for the no-call-no-show - went to bed late last night trying to finalize a few things for class today. Won't happen in the future as tasks will be more delegated throughout the group.<@Rohan Mishra> <@Tia (TJ) King> <@Sunny Ouyang>\nI will own up the role of gitmaster.\nI will approach this by creating on Github a project planner with each part that I will update with <@Rohan Mishra>.\nAfter doing this I will talk with <@Sunny Ouyang> and <@Tia (TJ) King> to see where you are, update things and start my role.\nMy deadline for this is Friday and communicate with each of you individually will try to do it on Monday next.Thanks for kicking this off <@Sunny Ouyang>, sorry for the delay was dealing w Doctors\n\n1. Over the weekend I finished parts of the BMC (which will finalize the MVP). This is also putting together many assumptions that we should disprove/prove through surveys/user interviewing\n2. Today I will finish that and designs\n3. Blockers - N/A<@Rohan Mishra> <@Tia (TJ) King> <@Egon Fiedler> For Daily Scrum:\n1. Yesterday was working on the Mnemonics Confirmation Page\n2. Today Hopefully finish up the Mnemonics Confirmation Page\n3. Blockers - None at the moment<@Rohan Mishra> <@Tia (TJ) King> <@Egon Fiedler> I won't be at school today, but so far I have almost completed 3 screens of our login process. The username/password VC, Mnemonic VC, and am almost finished with the Mnemonic Confirmation VC.1. Yesterday I interviewed Milad. set up a reminder to \u201creport  yesterday's completions/today working/any blockers\u201d in this channel at noon every Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, Pacific Daylight Time.1. Yesterday I combined the User Interviews, started putting together the BMC for the Letter of Engagement, started amassing best practices for running Sprints for how Sprints should be run for the Architect MVP\n2. Realized that I needed to complete the Business Model Canvas/Letter of Engagement in order to build the remainder of the styleguide which will allow me to mockup the \"User can add an account...\" card. The styleguide will enable others to take on design if they so wish. Letter of Engagement/BMC/styleguide/mocks WILL be completed by EOD Sunday\n3.

We know there is a problem! Make School has created the Student Council to address it.Remember, at the root we're trying to figure out:\n1. Is x student interested in taking action to make changes within in the Make School community? Why or Why not?\n2. What would encourage a student to try to make changes to something they do not like?\n3. Do people care enough to use a separate platform for these changes?I just created a calendar and invite everyone (except <@Dan Morse [SPD]> - lmk if you'd like an invite) to it, first Sprint Planning meeting on Monday! Please try to have those interviews done by tomorrow<@Egon Fiedler> has joined the channelDo you value interacting with the make school community?\nWhat drives you to do so?\nDo you think about ways to improve the environment @ school? in class?\nWhen/if MS had/has a policy you do not enjoy, what do you do?\nHow do you feel about Make School\u2019s surveys?\nDo you tend to stay anon on surveys?\nHas make school listened to your suggestions?\nIs it important for students to have a say on MS policies? why/why not?\nWould you fill surveys out more often if it was proportional to how seriously they\u2019d take you?<@Rohan Mishra> what should i be working on?RIP<@Willie Johnson> has left the channelok folks i'll sync up with you when the entire team is present\n\nplease make sure you have your outline complete and then ping me on slack when you're ready for review and i'll come down and collab with y'allI will be late my Lyft is taking a long time :man-shrugging: in the meantime check this out <@Sunny Ouyang> check this out: <https://github.com/matterinc/web3swift>won\u2019t be there today buddies No react at allI\u2019m in the process Did you do a tutorial?<@Rohan Mishra> I've been getting started with it, but not efficient with it yetHey everyone, I forgot to send out a calendar invite for a Sprint planning meeting, so we'll do that in SPD tomorrow. In the meantime I'll reach out to <@Dani Roxberry [BEW]> and see if she's available to stop by during our class tomorrow/sometime before to look at the cards I've outlined on paper before I turn them into digital cards. How much react have you guys looked at, <@Tia (TJ) King> <@Sunny Ouyang>?<https://twitter.com/avsa/status/1037703987296985092>This is a great Twitter thread which highlights bits of the paper, I especially like the little infographicWe\u2019ll also have Thursday during class as Lab/Sprint meetings, etc<https://github.com/Meeshbhoombah/architect/blob/docs/whitepaper.md><!channel> I'm running late, prescription taking forever to pickup what's up at the pharmacy lmao. I'm not sure what we're doing today, but we certainly need to define \"Done\" for our Sprints. I would appreciate it if you guys could go ahead and take a look at these articles:\n<https://medium.com/@dannysmith/the-definition-of-done-what-does-done-actually-mean-ef1e5520e153>\n\n<https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html>\n\nAnd collaboratively discuss definitions for Done and take notes. Once I get there I'll pitch the tech stack (which we could change) that I think works well, and we can concretely put our definition of Done in a doc.Hmmmm I\u2019d be down to try thatlet's talk during senior spd planning this morning :grin: like what I see so far!!<@Dani Roxberry [BEW]> your input would be especially appreciated here Thoughts? Okay great, so based off the Doodle we'll have Sprint Planning on Mondays at 10:30 (to 12:00) and Sprint Retrospectives on Fridays at 1:00 (to 2:30). I'll send out a calendar invite for these. I want to experiment with the idea of not having these in-person, but rather over a service like Google Hangouts. We'll do in-person for the first couple sprints just to have something to test against. The reasoning is that it'll encourage us to separate ideas and work from the person, so criticism is easier to give and receive. There's also the added benefit of not having to find a room to work in. the time is ripe for a project like thisThis is crazy - Vitalik just dropped a paper regarding the exact problem we're trying to solve, and it aligns really well with what we're working on - <https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3243656>hmm i wish there was a way to @channelll without mentioning Dan and Dani lol<!channel> Let's get this vote completed on the Doodle so we can start buidl-ing :muscle:Great!

Here's a quick lowdown on how these meetings will go down: <https://www.mitchlacey.com/intro-to-agile/scrum/sprint-planning-meeting>\n\nI'm gonna spend the  *weekend* fleshing out a process for us to build and ill put it in a doc so we're all aware of what's up, we can discuss it on Monday and adjust the process accordingly. I think we should dedicate the next week to just learning, but again we can discuss that on Monday.I\u2019m cool w daniWe won't meet today, however, we can choose timings to meet weekly on Mon/Fri via Doodle (Ill send a link), and I'll send a bunch of resources to get you start thinking about the project. First meeting on Monday. Anyone have a preference as to who put advisor should be? I was thinking Dani, she has back end experience and is interested in dApps (decentralized applications, which is essentially what we'll be building) In-person wins, so Monday's and Friday's we'll have our Planning/Retrospective meetings (respectively on those Days).<@Sunny Ouyang> <@Willie Johnson> sorry for pings, I would like to send the link to pick a time to meet so would be great if you can vote by the end of the dayAfter this decision we'll choose a time/poll \"Which do you prefer?\" \"In-Person\" \"Hangouts\":white_check_mark: Poll successfully deleted./poll What do you prefer \"In-Person\" \"Hangouts\"We can do a Google HangoutsWait, we don't have to do this in personLet's pick a time for tomorrow that we can use as the weekly retrospectiveWhen do your classes end <@Willie Johnson>, <@Tia (TJ) King>Willie what r u takinSamearchethtect looks like a mouthfulI like architect betterAyyye, thanks for the inv.

I did it by setting up an external auth API for mine on another server. so the CLI has to connect to it to autheticateIt's more of a permissions thing. This is a multi-user application, very similar to a messaging app. I need to have users \"logged in\" (really just know who's currently using it) so that I know who the message is coming from...Quick question: why do you need user authentication? Typically, CLI applications would be single-user applications that allow you to manipulate something on your own machine. Some people have users in their CLI app because they're collecting statistics or something like that. Is that the case here?Anyone know about data persistence in a CLI?

Dependency management before go modules was mostly left up to 3rd party libraries such as dep, govendor, vgo. Now with go modules you can create go projects with multiple packages and external dependencies in any path (except the go path) and the compiler will automatically handle the downloading and updating at run-time/compile-time.<https://blog.golang.org/modules2019>Great question! golang was initially released without a package/dependency manager (pip in python, npm/yarn in node). \n\nIn response, the community developed several solutions. The lack of official dependency management/vendoring forced devs to implement half baked tooling in production codebases -- `dep` is an artifact of this process.\n\nI really, really prefer the new gomodules package to handle vendoring and dependency management.

Have your function print out the output and look at the `cases_test.go` file to make sure it matches. Note: you will need to run go test with the -v flag to see the output.my `luhn` test for exercism keeps failing, but always at \"059\". It should be true according to the algorithm unless I am understanding it wrong because \"59\" is true (which passes) and both their sums are 10. Anyone know what's happening?Here is a little playground I made to demonstrate the power of pointer receiver methods in go. I promise it isn't as complicated as it sounds! It's a great way to make methods you can call on your structs. For example if you wanted to call create, read, update, or delete on a struct that represents your database model :white_check_mark:  <https://play.golang.org/p/4g0BIHB-UcC>An interesting article on how the order of your types in a struct declaration can affect memory consumption! <https://medium.com/@felipedutratine/how-to-organize-the-go-struct-in-order-to-save-memory-c78afcf59ec2>`team := Team{}` and `team := &amp;Team{}` both allocate a fresh instance of the struct. However in the second example: `team := &amp;Team{}` the variable team is set to the address in memory of the fresh instance of the struct whereas in the first example, team is just set to the fresh instance of the struct. See <https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#composite_literals> for a more detailed explanation. I generally always use the `team := Team{}` format and add the &amp; when I am actually taking the address.This message was deleted.<https://medium.com/@kyawmyintthein/building-golang-restful-api-with-echo-framework-1-422abc78e3a7><https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis>Here is a code snippet of `Bind` in action. We create a struct of type `User` and then inside of the struct define the way the data should be presented to the end user. Inside of our GET request to `users`, a new User is created with both fields filled out.

I have something like this : &lt;input type=\"hidden\" name=\"client_id\" value=\"1234\"&gt; and it can be easily found when inspecting the DOM.<@Medi Assumani> has joined the channelAlso this <https://vasanthk.gitbooks.io/react-bits/> has soo many good React patterns, techniques, tips and tricks that I had no idea about, totally improving my code :fire:My favorite React VS code extension rn -  <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jawandarajbir.react-vscode-extension-pack><@Nicolai Safai> that is what I was saying is fixed has the same effect.. you just have to use calc for the container height. Pure css and compatible with all browsers. Last time I tried using sticky just a few months ago, it didnt work in Firefox or Edge.In the past, I've implemented sticky navbars using JavaScript, but I'm a big fan of doing this in css. After all, this is a styling decision, and putting it in css feels like better separation of concerns, but that's just my opinion :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nYou're right that you can also use `position: relative` on parent and `position: absolute` on child to accomplish this without sticky, and that has better browser compatibility.\n\nAnyways, in my case I used it for a RoR table where I didn't want to do inline JS on every TH element and I didn't want to write CofeeScript either. And just 2 lines of CSS made it work in seconds! Data says that most users of the table are using Safari and Chrome so I should be okay with sticky.. Browser support: <https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-sticky>\n==&gt; Mainly missing IE, and some oddball mobile browsers like Baidu and Opera MobileIt's a nice explanation but I am still hesitant to use it because of browser compatibility. You can always use fixed or to position within a container absolute positioning with the container being relative. To deal with the issue of exact sizing (as fixed elements are outside the container they are inside) you can use `calc(100vh - 50px)` as an example.Can't believe I never knew about `position: sticky` ! What a find...\n\n```.nav-bar{\n    position: sticky;\n    top: 0px;\n}```\n\n<https://medium.com/@elad/css-position-sticky-how-it-really-works-54cd01dc2d46>I came across this recently: <https://github.com/h5bp/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions>I was wondering how Typescript compiles it to be valid Javascript :thinking_face: interestingAn article on private scope in JS that I'm trying to wrap my head around :smile: <https://philipwalton.com/articles/implementing-private-and-protected-members-in-javascript/>separate! or at least that's what the airbnb style guide saysIn most data structures insertion order is not maintained. Therefore its not a stable, unique ID.If you declare defaultProp for a Component does that innately declare the propType for what could be accepted or do those have to be separate..?Just read in another article that if you\u2019re pushing elements into the array or mutating it that the data won\u2019t display correctly, interesting Reading that it\u2019s much better, more optimal to use stable unique IDs as keys when mapping in React as apposed to the item index. But I\u2019m not sure why :thinking_face: <https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html#keys><@Medi Assumani> has left the channel<@Brian Nguyen [TA]> has joined the channelYou can also force a re-render with `this.forceUpdate()`But can't you download css like bootstrap so that you can delete conflicting code?Simply amazing UI kit <https://reakit.io/>I've had this happen a few times now, forgetting that just returning something doesn't call the render again so i'm stuck wondering why things aren't working lolYeah for sure this is the solution! :pray::skin-tone-3::blue_heart:Also I believe that the callback is unnecessary with await syntax, as awaiting <http://axios.post|axios.post> actually returns a response which can be handled like this\n\n```\nconst res = await <http://axios.post|axios.post>('/event', eventData)\n```I think it's because you're not rendering the redirect, you're only returning it within the axios request callback. You should probably update a boolean in state that keeps track of if the component needs to be directed, and then in your render perform a check on that piece of state.<https://github.com/AwesomeZaidi/Clubs-App-Frontend/tree/asim/leader-view>I have a createEvent form component that upon being submitted calls this function that does an axios post and returns a response with event data successfully, and i'd like to finally finish the handler function by redirecting to another component. Line 32 is logged successfully also.Ah for some reason this `Redirect` won't trigger, anyone have any ideas?You are right that you should only load the stylesheets you need. For example, don't load your stylesheet for the homepage on other pages (if you have a separate homepage stylesheet).\n\nHowever, I don't think the screenshot above is necessarily a bad sign. A lot of bigger websites can have conflicting css rules because they have built the equivalent of an internal bootstrap, which incidentally is what it looks like above:\n`flexbox` `align-items-center` seem like generic classes u can add to things, probably to make their CSS more DRYI have never heard that any amount of css negatively impacts performance... unless it\u2019s css animations which could.I'm thinking that maybe when you're a larger company your frontend team is forced to make different decisions like this for cross platform accessibility reasons potentially, things I'm not too knowledgeable about reallyFrom my understanding it's like best practice to try and load the minimal amount of styles needed for your page, for example having overwritten style properties loaded on the page is bad for performance. Just want to make sure that my thought there is true or if anyone can add onto it? Also, following that, is it bad when you look at large company sites and you see thisCool thing for Behance is doing for people to use their product and sharpen your UX skills! <https://www.behance.net/dailycreativechallenge><@Thomas Lee> has left the channel<https://product-college.slack.com/archives/CDNTXPLPJ/p1551481045001700> <!here>^ Shift of `width = 70%` to `width = 70vw` on the affected divShoutout to <@Nicolai Safai> who reminded me about the practical applications of vh and vw.

Even if I need to style a certain component only once.. I just use appropriate css selectors in the css file. This keeps everything separated and easy to read/modify.you  can use an external stylesheet wya?<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes>Actually, interesting I'm reading that attributes are actually just additional values that configure the elements/adjust their behavior so maybe it's totally fine to specify attributes inline on an element...In React, is it common to add on attributes to JSX expressions? I feel like when i was learning web foundations, it was best practice not write inline styles and have all of an elements attributes specified from the stylesheet specifically.Think it\u2019s mobile issueAlso <@Phyllis Wong> has some cool useful articles! <https://medium.com/@wong.phyllism/react-css-for-beginners-5f9f4a65184c>Anyone in few 2.1: Going through React tic tac toe tutorial and at first felt kind of bad not really understanding quite a bit of the schtuff there but turns out more people felt the same way lol so it just wasn't the most intuitive beginner tutorial i believe, i'm doing the codeacademy course on it and having a good time with that though!His face is transparent to me and there is a red flash randomly on the screen.

List the things that you have tried to solve itthen i would think the render is recalled, and my adminView is hit and so is the showIncomingRequest function that should then ideally display my list :confused:i changed it now so on the button click a function is called that sets stateHey <@Mitchell Hudson [FEW]> <@Brian Nguyen [TA]> I'm actually still stuck on this one if you could take a look - <https://github.com/AwesomeZaidi/Clubs-App-Frontend/tree/asim/basic-views/src/Components/Dashboard><@William Bogans> has left the channel<!channel> React Study questions for the week.<@Phyllis Wong> has left the channelSounds like you want to set a variable on state. something like this.state.showSomething = false. Then set this to true when when you click the button. (e) =&gt; this.setState({showSomething: true}). In your render method check this value using one of the conditional rendering techniques.\n\nYou don't want to return any JSX from the buttons click. Instead you want to button click to set some logic that triggers a render and have the render method do the work of showing something.Not sure if this is the problem, but you are missing `type=\"submit\"` on your button. It should be:\n\n```&lt;button className=\"black_btn\" type=\"submit\"&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;```My Code: <https://github.com/AwesomeZaidi/Clubs-App-Frontend/blob/asim/basic-views/src/Components/Dashboard/Dashboard.jsx>An alternate solution i found is probably better, just creating a new Component class when that's called on the button click but then i have to instantiate my props and everything again in that new Component - wondering what my options in this scenario are and how to wieght out the pro's and con's, like is it less or more efficient to avoid creating a new Component class?I'm in a Component Class and in my render return, if I click a button, I call a function that returns some jsx, i'm able to log out the jsx but it won't actually render on the page, i'm trying to understand why.Hey does anyone wanna help me on some React stuff?Awesome!

(\n    &lt;Home /&gt;\n  ) : (\n    &lt;Redirect to=\"/login\" /&gt;\n  )\n)}/&gt;```Also I somewhat understood how the history push was working behind the scenes but I commented it out because I wasn't sure what purpose it served in my app, it seems like a built in mechanism to allow users to keep going back and fourth on pages and essentially just remembering the order of the pages they viewed?Hey I was wondering if anyone has worked with Redirect yet in React Router? I'm trying to do a simple redirect within a project, and here's how I'm doing it - but I was wondering if anyone could potentially offer me a simpler solution? <https://gist.github.com/AwesomeZaidi/d12c76fdbe2f7c09623b91987b16a941>Hmm so i've got an input in my App.js with a handleSubmit func that does my API call to set the data to the Apps state, then my renderWeather function gets passed that state data and loads the Weather component.\n\nSoo I'm thinking in my App Component, I should have a state property isLoading... then when my Weather component mounts, change its parents state to finishedI think this sounds like an opportunity to use ComponentDidMountAh, I thought that this would be like a preloader to as the website its loading but mistake me if I'm wrong, it's actually going to be a pre loading message for when you hit submit and are waiting for the data to be fetched and rendered?\n\nThere's 2 challenge 4's for some reason, I was referring to the one below Stretch challenges :slightly_smiling_face:<https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/documentation-intro>You can use state. \n\nYou should have three \u201cstates\u201d to track. \n\nWhen the component is idle and you haven\u2019t started to fetch anything. \n\nWhen you loading data. The fetching process has started. You probably clicked the submit button. \n\nWhen the process is complete. Fetch has completed successfully or with an error. \n\nAt each of these steps you can set state. This will trigger a render. In your render method you can use conditional rendering to control what\u2019s displayed. \n\nThis seems like it is aimed at the question you were asking above.

A referral (external or internal) means your application will probably get looked at sooner than if you applied through other means.\n\nAsk your mentor, Make School staff, instructors and former colleagues/managers for recommendations at companies where they have connections.\nAsk internal employees at companies you apply to for a referral (after you have established a warm connection).<!here> Please remember to check the list of Mentors. If you apply to any of those companies let me know, I can help raise your visibility with the hiring team by forwarding on an email from you (see template from Dan). <@Rohan Mishra> also shared this master list: <https://www.producthunt.com/alternatives/hunter>^ building off this. The instructors just decided to try our best to package Term5 class content into technical interview problems. This way we\u2019ll use class time to master the material while also practicing for interviews. We feed two birds with one vegan worm :bug: :bird:\n\u2026\nReminder it\u2019s ok to leave class for an interview. Try to schedule interviews outside of class, and if you have to miss, message the instructor.You can message them with a premium account. Other tools we\u2019ve shared are <http://hunter.io|hunter.io>, the chrome extension Contact Out, and the gmail plugin clearbitHow do I get their emails? I just signed up from premium.I recommend everyone still job searching keep their tech interviewing skills sharp by going to the interviewing lab at least 1x/week.*Demonstrating your CS skills in your resume:*\nResumes could have a skill\u2019s section that includes content from CS such as \u201cClassical Data Structures and Algorithms: Linked Lists, Markov Models \u2026 etc\u201d. This will help you articulate the skills you\u2019ve developed in CS on your resume.\n\n*Free Linkedin Premium trial - cancel in 30 days*\nA few of you signed up for LinkedIn premium account trials. This gives you access to data on your skill fit with roles, and most importantly, grants access to contact information of recruiters and warm contacts.

When hard things happen, there's often no one to talk to. Likewise is a small startup developing Relatable, an app that helps people have real, 1-on-1 conversations about the things that matter to them. In a world where we are more and more disconnected from each other, Relatable works to bridge the divide between us to get us talking and listening to each other again. We've all been through hard things -  job loss, a diagnosis, a recent divorce. Relatable is a space to talk with another person who gets what it's like. We believe that no matter how capable and competent we are, none of us can go it all alone. If this resonates with you and you meet the requirements below, we would love to hear from you. \n\nWe are looking for a technical generalist interested in advancing the mission of Relatable with experience in mobile development (preferably both iOS and Android). This is a remote position, though, if possible, we would like to meet in-person in SF periodically when all our schedules allow. \nEssential applicant attributes include: \ncreative thinking, self-advocacy (we want to hear your thoughts and ideas and expect you to make recommendations), proactive problem-solving, and a commitment to the mission of Relatable.  \nThis position will be on a contract basis, with possibility for longer term employment. Pay range $8,000 - $10,000 for 4 months. \nIf interested, please check out our website at <http://www.berelatable.com|www.berelatable.com> and send your letter of interest and resume to <mailto:michelleb@berelatable.com|michelleb@berelatable.com>\u201d<@Aakash (Kash) Sudhakar> I\u2019m interested too!<@Aakash (Kash) Sudhakar> I\u2019m interested!<@Aakash (Kash) Sudhakar>MEEEEEE<@Aakash (Kash) Sudhakar> sign me up!Interested <@Aakash (Kash) Sudhakar> Anyone interested in applying to be a summer UI/UX intern at Microsoft?

Refactoring is hard because there are several ways to solve problems. Once you've figured out a solution that works, it can be hard to think of different ones. Determining which solution is better is not always obvious, and can vary based on the code context and frankly, personal preference._\n\n&gt; *My advice to getting better at refactoring is simple: read more code.*\n\n<https://dev.to/jnschrag/refactoring-the-worst-code-i-ve-ever-written-42c7>^ Added it to the slide dec :laughing:super duper lit - <https://github.com/Raathigesh/majestic?fbclid=IwAR1PntQQSujj4aHlxlwWVFKM51kNYRcB4zc7-RLTQv2809wTaG2LF9oqBFQ>I\u2019m tutoring in the Great Hall today until 1:30pm.

Sprint Planning Templates are Golden:yellow_heart:, do not stray from them*: Every year, students create their own meeting format/agenda and almost all suffer and are less effective:man-facepalming::skin-tone-4:.  Why?  The sprint process in our template has been honed over multiple decades and is used by hundreds/thousands of teams:runner::skin-tone-4:. Other industries are beginning to use this Sprint Planning process. So, if you use another format, know you are going against the accumulated knowledge of a thousand engineer army :crossed_swords: :man-man-boy-boy::woman-woman-boy-boy::man-man-boy-boy::woman-woman-boy-boy: :crossed_swords: . Use the template, exactly as prescribed. You won\u2019t regret it :wink:\n\n*2. Over-communicate with your team; class attendance and participation is key: :speaking_head_in_silhouette:* I noticed some teammates sad to find their collaborators not present in class yesterday. It\u2019s tough when you are giving a project your all and others are not present. Let\u2019s hold each other accountable to our best communication yet and to showing up fully. It\u2019s expected of you in industry and the instructors and I won\u2019t let you drop your standards to anything less.\n\n*Great progress on the projects folks\u2026* Nicolai and I loved the early work you  are showing. Be sure to keep improving, keep learning, and take each team collaboration challenge as an opportunity for growth. Shout out to our TAs <@Nicolai Safai> for the great feedback and <@Justin Sitter> for holding us all accountable and checking in on absent students.<@Aktar Zaman> has left the channelThanks Alan, I\u2019m adding this to an appendix slide in the presentation from Today\u2019s classGreat questions asked upstairs: When calculating your team\u2019s sprint *velocity*, your team should:\n(1) only count points for tasks that *fully meet the definition of \u201cDone\u201d* your team agreed to AND\n(2) count the number of *points estimated* the task would take, NOT the actual number of hours it took\n\nThis is really important to follow exactly because it\u2019s how your velocity calculation will help you commit to the right number of points while planning and estimating the next sprint. Please announce <@Dani Roxberry [BEW]>shoutout to <@Makhmud Islamov> for the :fire: idea... super viable :ok_hand::skin-tone-5:<https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JsqI_SFi1245W0hwrMXbCA7SB1LdXsDuVqF_TM-6DVk/edit><!here> Check your calendar for your SPD class location today.

Once we boiled this idea down to its key elements, we had to build it. In the process of building Tapioka, we went through a series of coding sprints.I have learned about software solving similar problems with eating out. My friend Kendra and I have generated an idea of our own.Our stakeholders are the children and their parents who come with a completely different set of user concerns. We turned to multiple experts online to find best practices for building apps for children.\n\nTanya Junell, a freelance Interactive Designer offered a gold mine of information about designing with kids in mind in her article \u201cThe Definitive Guide to Building Apps For Children\u201d. Our web app needed to be fun and engaging for kids but also safe and simple to use for parents as well.<@Tim Kaing> <@Wenzel Lowe>\nA newsfeed will then display winners and losers of bets as well as an individual profile that shows their win/loss ratio in hopes to gamify the betting process. But where and how did we start?\nIn order to achieve our goal of developing this application, we decided it was best to develop using agile methodology and plan out our sprints.Teamwork towards a goal is the main thing that makes a team work and together it prompts a better experience.Common values seem especially important when looking for relationships, because couples often spend a lot of time together. Furthermore, because mutually held opinions represent common ground, people can readily understand one another\u2019s behaviors and thinking patterns as they pertain to their shared views.This platform could potentially streamline and ease the tenant-landlord relationship.\n\nSince Team Smuffins realized that it would be hard to maintain users given that once a user found a suitable rental, the would stay there and not use the app, our target demographic would be users that travel for work.Several of our industry contacts raised concerns about the issue of security. For example, how would a platform like this work with sensitive or proprietary data? A competing company could, in theory, download all the data available to the volunteers and use that data to bring a product to market first. Such was the case brought up by our pharmaceutical researcher and neuroscientist.\nHowever, this was mitigated by the potential for prestige. From the scientist's perspective their goal would be to use this platform as a tool to publish more research papers. This is commonly one of the metrics used to secure funding for a department, project, or otherwise. With a platform like this the scientific community would be able to focus more on their research rather than monotonous tasks such as the one highlighted above.When a user downloads the app for the first time, he/she is prompted to consent to providing the current location. Secondly, the user needs to login with Facebook or Google accounts.Towards this goal, I partnered with a fellow Make School student, Sam Harrison.With 20,000 Googlers protesting the company\u2019s culture and harassment policies and the outcry of millions from the #MeToo Movement, along with my personal experiences as a woman in Silicon Valley, providing support for women has become a high priority task.\n\nFor me, this looks like leading a weekly women\u2019s group at Make School, where I study computer science: an industry reporting 73% of workers believe it is sexist.However, if you eat that same amount of meat everyday, then the impact is much larger.\nThat is what led us to make FoodPrint, an app that tracks the food you eat and estimates how much carbon is produced. We combined our knowledge of agile development practices and our interest in the environmental domain in making this product.\n\nWhen deciding on an industry, we were most interested in ideas related to change and making life better for peopleStudent workload is on the rise as more students are taking harder classes in order to get into their dream college.\nLikewise, the massive workload students are taking on is leading to a massive rise in students stress levels. What if there was a way to ease the stress with an effective workload visualization tool<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T1oqHFoRo0kl7mPUTFupmsoEkLYltKsVgtqyGKDaCgY/edit?usp=drive_web&amp;ouid=102349547791146369642><https://www.peta.org/features/ringling-bros-elephant-cruelty/>Elephants are my favorite animal.

Break down problem-solving into smaller steps* - students get overwhelmed by big projects when they think about solving it all at once. The best coders, instead, break down their project planning into phases, starting at the high level and progressing into more and more detail.\n- Phase 1: Conceptual: what is the outcome of the project. \u201cFinal project should be able to xyz\u201d\n- Phase 2: Functions: write each function and comment on what the code must carry out.\n- Phase 3: Function inputs &amp; outputs: comment on what arguments are passed in and returned from functions?\n- Phase 4: First function: code and test it\n- Phase 5-N: Second function, code and test it. Third function, code and test. Forth function, code and test \u2026 etc.\nThis phase by phase approach makes the project more approachable.\n*2. Get feedback on steps and strategy before starting each phase*.\n*3. Test functions as you code*. Don\u2019t code the whole project and then run it. You\u2019ll face a ton of errors and will have difficulty debugging. Instead, test and return/print values within your FIRST function before you move on to the second. This will ensure that the baseline of your code works and will prevent you from passing down errors into other functions. You\u2019ll also get the joy of feeling the code work bit by bit instead of the frustration of trying to debug a massive code beast.<!here> there are monitors for paired programming on the second floor.

I'll do my best to be there though. Excelsior! One huddle member has found me so far!Also, if you don\u2019t find me by ~9:45, you should probably just go meditate in the usual huddle location\u2026 :stopwatch::relieved::peace_symbol:I'm not at school yet but he's in the quiet roomConfirming that I\u2019m hiding in a place that\u2019s not obvious and also not behind any locked doors!

(NOTE: _It\u2019s still in production, but basics are functional!

I\u2019m running a bit late for huddles this morninggood morn! I will be a few minutes late.Hey guys I won\u2019t be in huddles today as I think I\u2019m getting sick. Going to stay in bed and see how I feel later. :rainbow:.My goal is to practice technical coding challenges, stay on track in the classes (read ahead of class course work), and be active, work on the SPD project with my group!My goal is to get better at Go (by completing more tutorials e.g. tour of go and exercism) and read some Effective Go. Also project planning for spd.Also, since we didn't reflect last Friday, does anyone mind if we reflect in addition to stand ups 2mrw??Can do! Hopefully it works My goal is to finish and ship v1.0.2 of my assigned app and review my unit testing with Dani tomorrow to then learn some TDD and BDD for the rest of the weekMorning warriors! I'll be visiting my google team today so I won't be at all hands or MS until later in the day.<@Erick Sanchez> Could you add an @channel to Slackbot's message?My goal for the beginning of this week is to get familiar with the twillio API and help architect our SPD project. Hopefully I'll also get some fun data science stuff to work on as well.Understood, that should be great for us! Looking forward to this week, folks! <@Aakash (Kash) Sudhakar> Yeah, that's the second half of Freestyle Fridays.  We review the goals for the week and update each other on how they've gone. Last week we didnt do it because there were other things going on.This week, I will continue my reading of Eloquent JavaScript and continue to familiarize myself with GoHey <!here>, I do have a question about the whole goal-setting thing. Setting them is great and all, but do we have a system in place for really getting them done? Slackbot's reminders are cool but just reminders from a system that no one else can hold you to (brings us back to the accountability thing). :slack: :question: \n\nJust as a suggestion, we may want to consider kickstarting Technical Thursdays or Freestyle Fridays with a lightning round of having all of us report out on how we've been successful/unsuccessful in meeting our weekly goals. :zap: \n\nJust some food for thought! Would love to know what ya'll think! :brains: :thinking_face: This week, I am going to build materials for DS 2.3, starting advanced data visualization with Python and D3.js  This week, I'm going to apply to at least five jobs/internships, finish my current unit in my Systems Bio course, and catch up with the work in my Golang class! :aakash: :make-school: This week I\u2019m going to catch up on what I missed in data science and bew and maybe get ahead?Dexter\u2019s Lavoratory This week, I\u2019m gonna work on two leetcode problems and read another chapter of Cracking the Coding Interview <!channel> ^^Reminder: Happy Monday!

I\u2019ve installed Risky Picker (per <@Erick Sanchez>\u2019s recommendation) to randomly pick :busts_in_silhouette: two people each week :calendar: from <#CCGSVB8HW|rainbow-warriors> :muscle::skin-tone-4::rainbow::crossed_swords: ; one to lead \u201cTechnical Thursdays\u201d:female-technologist::skin-tone-4::calling::computer: and someone else to lead \u201cFreestyle Fridays\u201d :speaking_head_in_silhouette::world_map::man_in_lotus_position::skin-tone-2::man-with-bunny-ears-partying::female_mage::skin-tone-2::cyclone:. Risky Picker will announce :mega: each week\u2019s leaders :female-teacher: Monday afternoons at 3:00PM :clock3:.\n\nI am new to Risky Picker so we\u2019ll try it out and if it doesn\u2019t work we can try an alternative! Risky Picker\u2019s options for naming a task are limited so Technical Thursdays\u2019 leader will be announced with an association to getting coffee/tea/brew :coffee: and Freestyle Fridays\u2019 leader will be announced in association to getting water:droplet::ocean:.  If for whatever reason you cannot present when you\u2019ve been selected to, go ahead and move forward with asking someone to lead for you and message <#CCGSVB8HW|rainbow-warriors> to let us know.\n\n:rotating_light:WARNING: Risky Picker claims to use \u201cAdult language\u201d. It does not specify how extreme this language might be. So, if this turns out to be a problem we\u2019ll reconsider.\n\nFamiliarize yourself with Risky Picker here: <https://mellorandsmith.com/riskypicker>\n\n\n\nTLDR: Risky Picker will tell you if you\u2019re presenting this week on Mondays at 3:00PM.

For those who will be at huddle today, here\u2019s the activity:\n&gt;Partner with someone (ideally in your concentration) and explain your code from a recent project. Your partner can offer suggestions on how to improve the *code quality and documentation.*\nI\u2019m coming late (again)\u2026 :man-shrugging:Woke up a little late and I won't be able to make huddles today!I\u2019m a bit under the weather from the trip still and will not make it to huddles this morningNot going to be able to make it into huddles today!Sorry to for your loss Elliot. My prayers are with him.Sorry for your loss Elliot, hearts and hugs going out to you!Hey guys, I\u2019m not showing up today. I woke up to some sad news, my uncle passed away this morning... I\u2019m just not in the right headspace for huddles LolI found candy that perfectly describes our huddleOh snap! Sorry for being delinquent y\u2019all. I didn\u2019t sleep well again and won\u2019t make it to huddle at all today. Happy Friday! :calendar::relieved:And my ETA is about 9:45... :sleepy::alarm_clock::pensive:Today\u2019s huddle @group question is...\n&gt;What topics would you like to learn more about and why?\n\nWe\u2019ll also need to select someone to lead huddle tomorrow! (Ideally who hasn\u2019t yet)I\u2019m howling <@Nyapal Gatkuoth [RA]>I'm also going to be late to huddles / possibly miss them as I am running late. Still at the Vantaggio...lmaooo <@Nyapal Gatkuoth [RA]> I can\u2019t with youOkay, that checks out.Yes, I was told this is the cool guys huddle &amp; since I am a cool guy I am hereNya... are you in our huddle?I also won't be in huddles today, going to tulsa. Yesterday I worked on adding <http://socket.io|socket.io> to my SPD project, today I will be getting unblocked on superheroes and continuing to work on my SPD projectI won\u2019t be in to huddles today because I am going to Tulsa :airplane_departure: Yesterday, I worked on deploying my SPD project to Heroku. I\u2019m still blocked on getting mLab installed with that particular project. Today I\u2019ll be traveling. Sending some rainbow vibes your way :sparkles::rainbow:\u201cThere is no _try_. Only _do_.\u201d :muscle:gfto nya! :kissing_heart:Won't make it in today: recovering from some late morning training. Here's my traditional standup. \n\nACCOMPLISHED: Prepped and taught DS 2.1 on Monday and worked on a bunch of tutorials and assignments yesterday. Focused most of my work on instructional stuff and not much on personal coding. \n\nPROGRAMMING LAB: I'll try and clean up the course materials and in-class activities for today's DS class.\n\nBLOCKERS: As always, attempting to balance coding work, TA work, and athletic work is tricky to say the least. My personal coding work has suffered the most these past few months. I'll try and remedy that this Thursday and Friday.I\u2019m not feeling well and won\u2019t make it in for huddle. :face_with_head_bandage: Someone please lead our @groupIll be absent today on account of my back acting up like a bad child in a grocery store.<@Nyapal Gatkuoth [RA]> has joined the channelI'll currently doing curriculum development so I won't be inI\u2019ll arrive at 9:42. Today\u2019s @group topic:\n&gt;What is something unique about your culture or background that you'd like other people to know about?I will be late to huddles eta 10 mins<@Carlos Alba> has left the channelI joined by clicking the wrong link lulGtfo carlos<@Carlos Alba> has joined the channelHi I won't be in either to make sure I get enough rest to fend off this sinus infection before Tulsa.\n\nAs for the prompt: there are so many things I could say about any of the cultures that have shaped me as a person, but instead I'm going to talk about something related that's been on my mind recently. People who grow up on the internet need to learn to code switch and conform to different communication standards across communities. There's an idea that people raised in a culture other than their parents have certain traits different from the general population. For example, they're supposed to be more flexible, open minded, and tolerant of change. I've been wondering if young millenials and gen z are going to marked by their exposure to the internet in this way. If so, I think this is a really good thing.Hey Squad, I won\u2019t be in huddle today. I have some TAing hours to do today until late, so I\u2019ll need all the time I can get to work on some of my projects.We get to experience the living conditions of heavy polluted cities around the world for a few day :relaxed:<@Betsy Bailey><!group>: Friendly reminder to stay inside, avoid physical activity or prolonged/heavy exertion outdoors until California\u2019s wildfire apocalypse blows over! :evergreen_tree::fire::mask::no_entry_sign::man-bouncing-ball::man-lifting-weights:\n\nAir forecast: <https://airnow.gov/index.cfm?action=airnow.local_city&amp;zipcode=94103>Slept in, ETA ~9:40.

Just a reminder for tomorrow's huddle, don't dismiss any of your notifications unless you have to open it like reply to a message.where u at?See y\u2019all soon <!group>! Today\u2019s topic:\n&gt; Take our one of your more complex coding projects from this term or last term. \n&gt;Pick three programming concepts that are present in your project, and explain to a partner how you effectively utilized them in your code.\n&gt;Note: technical discussion is a key part of coding interviews, so treat this huddle as a useful part of your interview practice.(I\u2019m moving from one location of the vantaggio to another and apparently I have to leave this location by 12 today with my stuff and then potentially wait at the new location until 3pm or until my room is ready...)I\u2019m moving today so I\u2019m going to miss huddles.\n\nThree concepts that I have in one of my assignments are modularity, abstraction, and separation of concerns.\n\nMaybe Faith, you and I can get together tomorrow and code review each other?I'm still having symptoms today, so I will not be in for huddles. Can't really do the huddle topic today by myself :shrug::skin-tone-5:Going to miss huddles tomorrow for the sake of minimizing the spread of disease.Gotta celebrate the small wins, Johnny! I won\u2019t make it to huddle. (Arriving at ~10)<@Alan Davis [CS]> Thank you! There's no way I can recover without _rainbow_ vibes :rainbow::alan:Have some extra _rainbow_ vibes!!! :rainbow::sparkles::wink:I made it<@Jamie McCrory> <@Briant (Elliot) Oliveira> Thanks y'all!

Slept through both my alarms.Might be a bit late this morning Feel better!Feel better Faith! Sending good vibes your way :sparkles:Hi, Rainbow Warriors :rainbow: :unicorn_face: :crossed_swords:. I\u2019m feeling sick today and I won\u2019t be at school. For SPD, my partner and I are working on an environmental food tracker.  I\u2019m excited about getting to figure out how to implement certain features to make it useful in displaying data. I\u2019ll arrive at ~9:35. Today\u2019s <!group> topic:\n&gt;Which classmate has supported the most and how? Who is someone you'd like to support more often?I'll be at MS today but I'll be preparing for my google interview that starts at 10a\n\nYesterday: practiced for interviews\nToday: practice for other interviews I have this week :books: :computer: Good morning. I\u2019m running late for huddles this morning as well.Will be late to huddles as well on account of voting!I might also be late to huddles on account of voting. Need to fill out and mail in my ballot...Might be late to huddles tomorrow because I need to jump through some annoying hoops to do my civic duty. Btw if anyone missed the voter registration deadline and still wants to vote hmu and we can go together, I have all the logistics figured out.I won't be at huddles today.I'll be finishing up my interview project today\n\nYesterday: Senior SPD, worked with Adriana on building the curriculum, began coding project for Affirm's interview\n\nToday: wrapping up coding project, a couple of phone calls with recruits at Instacart and Iterable. Then build a Eventbrite clone Not going to be able to make it to huddles today, phone interview in the morning. What I did yesterday was working on the backend of the Companion application and had a code review with <@Erick Sanchez>. Today I will be making a document discussing the pros and cons of a new technology my team will be using and to do more interview prep today. Blockers will be that I just have to keep following my routine. Have a good day y'all!Going to be doing an interview this morning Come with more ideas when you\u2019re all better We made suggestions for the suggestion box <@Matthew Harrilal> says he will lead :speak_no_evil:Good morning. I\u2019m not feeling well today and will be missing huddleNot coming in today! I\u2019ll be in recovery :face_with_thermometer:I\u2019ll miss Friday too! Milad and I will be out-of-office Fri-Sat 11/2-3 for ODSC (open data science conference).<!here>Friendly reminder that I\u2019ll miss huddle tomorrow due to a dentist appointment (that was rescheduled from last week). Who can lead tomorrow morning?<!here> no huddles today! All hands instead :)I wont be in for huddles today.Ah same boat hereI overslept and won\u2019t make it to huddle in time today. Here\u2019s today\u2019s topic though:\n&gt;What are you doing to ensure you and your product partner get off to an effective start? If you haven\u2019t thought about this, think of a strategy now.Running a bit late Morning y'all! I'll be 10 mins late to huddlesI will be absent from huddles today ya'll. What I did yesterday was manage to finally unblock myself from this hackerrank challenge with the help of <@Erick Sanchez>. I started my reddit clone and going to be finishing the tasks up to authentication today. After that I will continue interview prepping. My current blockers are just discipline so working on remaining productive throughout the day. Active ways I can go about that is to maintain my routine of working at Make School. Peace ~Matthew HarrilalI will be absent from huddles todayI\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m going to make it to huddles today. I\u2019ve had some insomnia tonight... :alarm_clock:. I\u2019m going to try to make it though....and I'll buy it 2mrw :DI will buy our cellphone basket from here...I won\u2019t be making it to huddles today! :grimacing:If you arrive late to huddles, feel free to find a comfortable position and try to join in on our meditation session. :100::rainbow::unicorn_face::heartpulse::rocket::tada:Leading the huddle todayI am :) :rainbow: :unicorn_face: #extraCreditShould I ?UmmmmmI won't be in today, at an interview I am leading next Friday's huddle :)See y\u2019all soon! ETA ~9:35Who\u2019s leading our huddle <!group> today?I won\u2019t be in huddle today I believe. Due to my interview.<https://ggia.berkeley.edu/practice/36_questions_for_increasing_closeness>Just hopped off an unexpected behavioral phone screen with Pathstream, a company I've been chatting with for a little while. Went well, despite the fact that their call quite literally woke me up. Regardless, here's my huddles response! \n\n1. Is there something you've dreamed about doing for a long time; if so, why haven't you done it yet? \n2. What are some of the best qualities that your closest friends/family/relationships would say you exemplify? \n3. In a sentence, tell me who you are. \n\nOn a side note, many of these questions are inspired by a larger list of questions called the 36 Empathy Questions. They were popularized a little while ago on the internet as the 36 Questions to Fall in Love with Anyone; in reality, they're questions to deeply connect and grow closer to someone who wants to do the same with you. \n\nI've sat down and done the 36 questions with several of my close friends and family over the past few years and can attest to dramatically improving relationships, understanding the habits and behaviors of someone I had previously disconnected with, and even salvaging relationships I thought had been broken. \n\n*HIGHLY* recommend you give it a try with a close friend/loved one... it could change your lives.Hey y\u2019all, I\u2019m sorry to have missed. I have an appointment coming up at 10 and couldn\u2019t make it. How do you find meaning in what you do or how you live?What does it mean to be happy?How do you cope with stress?So I thought I would miss huddle today but the dentist had to reschedule my appt for next week. :grimacing: Should arrive around ~9:40~. Actually, 9:45 is more realistic.I'll be 10ish mins late, and I forgot the cell phone basket :(Hey  y\u2019all, I\u2019m running late. I\u2019ll be there in 20min. If 20min passed by and I\u2019m still not there, please read this again I am meeting with my industry contact at 10.  I am at Make School but will want to head out before huddle ends. Just in case, here are the three questions that I would ask to know someone on a deeper level.  1.  What are you proudest of that don't get to talk about? 2.  What in your life do you feel most grateful?  3.  Who's do you look up to?Physical Therapy ran longer once again. I believe I\u2019ll be very late or absent from huddles.  I\u2019ve gone ahead and changed my appointments to be on Tuesday and Thursday during programming lab instead of rushing to class on those days. \n\nThat being said, here are my three questions.\n\n1. How do you define happiness? \n2. What is one thing you would change about yourself and why? \n3. What is your biggest regret in life? \n\nHello Rainbow Warriors! :rainbow: :gem: :unicorn_face: I am volunteering this morning at a local high school and won\u2019t make it to huddles. Three questions I would ask to get to know someone on a deeper level: 1) What is something that people don\u2019t often understand about you? 2) If you could live forever what would you do? 3) What makes you feel the most content/fulfilled/happy? ^ confirmed. He actually shouldn't come to schoolI will also not be in attendance as I am possibly getting sick :mask:.I willMeFriendly reminder that I\u2019ll miss huddle tomorrow due to a dentist appt. Who will be leading tomorrow morning?My favorite book series is Pendragon it\u2019s about a kid that goes into different worlds :earth_americas: and has an adventure in each one :snowboarder:My favorite books are the Dune series and the Harry Potter series. Kind of basic... I also like the works of Shakespeare.Totally overslept - stayed up a little late to work on projects and didn't keep track of the time until nearly 2AM. My apologies. I'll get ready but since it takes 30 min to commute, I'll post my huddles update here in case I don't make it on time. \n\nMy favorite books of all time are Douglas Hofstadter's _The Mind's I_, J. R. R. Tolkien's _The Hobbit_, Forrest E. Morgan's _Living the Martial Way_, and Khaled Hosseini's _The Kite Runner_. \n\nAbove all, highly recommend reading _The Kite Runner_: it's a very real and emotional journey into the life of two best friends worlds apart in Pakistan and how they impact each others' survival growing up during a time of racism, discrimination, and national crisis. Really moving and emotionally impactful - one of the first stories I remember reading growing up that made me cry. Super, super powerful.And also stretching today! YAAAYYY!!!ETA ~9:40. Today\u2019s huddle <!group> topic:\n&gt;(5 min) Each individually fill out this form for the WakaTime competition: <http://make.sc/wakatime-form|make.sc/wakatime-form>\n&gt;(15 min) What are your favorite books of all time? Pick one to recommend to your huddle group explain what they could get out of it?Running a bit late :alarm_clock:Want me to wake you up? :blush:Looking forward to stretches tomorrow! :woman-gesturing-ok::skin-tone-2: Unfortunately I may be late to huddles because I left my only reliable alarm at school today :grimacing: :iphone:Ah crap, I was trying to be early today but I think I\u2019ll be ~5 minutes late... :stopwatch::sweat:I'll be 10mins lateHey folks, I was actually planning on coming in as well but injured my leg again I think - can barely move my right leg to walk or get up without piercing pain up my knee. Gonna try some quick P.T. and stretching to heal it ASAP. In the meantime, here are my huddle answers. \n\nExecuted Well: Supporting and helping others level up as I have and contributing to a dynamic culture. \n\nTo Improve: Work-Life Balance and reflecting what Tim said with showing up to Make more energeticSee you soon <!group>! Today\u2019s topic:\n&gt; Remember the *Community Covenant* the class made during the retreat?\n&gt;We\u2019re going to revisit and reflect on that! <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QtCA7o-N3fAfyH3ZC21Mnv774V5ZkQzYqM_9SpvZuUQ/edit>\n&gt;*Question:* Which aspect of the covenant have you executed well and what is something new on the list you\u2019d like to do to contribute to our community culture. Share *specific examples* of actions you did/will take.Thanks for communicating. <@Johnathan Chen> and <@Matthew Harrilal>. Do you guys want to follow <@Tim Kaing>\u2019s lead above and respond to today\u2019s huddle topic here?Won\u2019t be able to make it to huddles today, have a doctors appointment.Won\u2019t be able to make it to huddles today :no_mouth: PT Appointment got rescheduled from the usual 7am to 9am for tomorrow. I will be missing huddles.\n\nTomorrow Morning's Huddle Answers:\n\nExecuted Well: Motivate each other \u2014 Pushed my roommates/friends to participate in hackathons, meetups, and spend more time programming.\n\nWhat I\u2019d like to contribute to community culture: Show up to school less sleep deprived and more positive.You just don't go...Oh wait we have all hands lol. Who do I message for that? Dan?Won't make it to huddles tomorrow :disappointed:#CommanderMonochromeYes?#TheDarknessThanks so much for the guilt trip, <!group>! I really appreciate it. :unamused: I\u2019m wearing black again because that\u2019s how I feel. :pensive:<@Aakash (Kash) Sudhakar> you gotta be at huddles to be in the photo!Someone photoshop me in there<!here> That moment that everyone shows up except our huddle leader :sob::rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:I\u2019ll be approximately 15 min 24 sec late, +/- 3 min 15 sec (with 84.7% probability)<!group>: Please start *product pitch feedback* at 9:30 and then 9:45 \u2013\n&gt;(15 min) Have 3 volunteers present their pitch to the rest of the group. Presentations are 3 minutes, and feedback can be shared out loud for 2 minutes.\n&gt;(15 min) In groups of 3, each person presents for 3 min and then gets 2 min of feedback (either written or verbal).I will be exactly 4 minutes and 28 seconds late. MI'll be 3mins late Hi all,\n\nProbably not gonna make it into huddles since I\u2019m up way too late and will likely be up even later because of a persistent MatPlotLib bug that simply won\u2019t die. It shall not best me tonight, even if it costs me a timely morning rise. So I\u2019ll just post my huddles update now.\n\nPitched to two people yesterday and got their feedback - will be happy to pitch to someone else tomorrow if they\u2019d like to see my project. If anyone wants some pitch help, please lemme know! Happy to help.Hey squad, I won\u2019t be there for our afternoon huddle, I\u2019m currently finishing PaySplit stuffs for tomorrowI'll be there in 5mins :bike: I don\u2019t feel well and won\u2019t make it today.Thanks for communicating, everyone who will be late or miss huddle today. Aakash has the right idea: if you can\u2019t make it at all, find a way to make it up later today so you get the value. Here\u2019s the <!group> activity:\n&gt;Pair with a partner who is in your concentration. Give each other feedback on each other's code quality using the Code Review Rubric, which articulates the standards and practice of high-quality code:\n&gt;<http://make.sc/code-review-rubric>Ayy I made it on time Hey, I will most likely miss huddles as well due to waking up late! I will find someone and show them my project.Yeah I'll also be missing the morning huddle - overtrained the past two days and need to rest up a little more before my legs fall off. Looks like the huddle topic entails a code review with someone in my concentration. I'll grab a Data Science student today and code review with them today!I have an appointment this morning and will most likely not make it this morning. See y\u2019all this afternoon! Will most likely be late once again due to physical therapy. <@Alan Davis [CS]> I\u2019m sorry my communication has been off lately. There are some things that are going on that is making it very difficult for me to focus on intensives. However, I have a new product I\u2019ve been working on this week. I\u2019ve shown a couple of people and got feedback, <@Kuan-Ying Fang> was one of them. I could give a solid presentation but I\u2019m asking to take some time off this week from Makeschool. I need some time alone.hey, guys. i'm not feeling great, so I think I'm going to head home. I'm not sure if my idea is going to work (uploading user uploaded pics to the bootstrap carousel) so I think I'm going to show the images differently. i will see you guys tomorrow, bright and early.Yesterday: Didn\u2019t accomplish anything i mentioned yesterday :confused: butt! i got tons of points on my networking points. I had four people at Asana download my app, and collected about six contacts at asana. Also, the meeting with <http://Academia.edu|Academia.edu> went REALLY well. he\u2019ll be pushing my resume along to their recruiting team.\n\ntoday: focus on exploring more companies and understanding the interview process more at Tech Inclusion\n\nBlockers: sleepI'll be there in 15 minsWill do my wireframe testing with some people at Make after my morning call!<!group>: Go ahead and get started with *user testing your wireframe with 3 different partners*, we\u2019ll do the standup when I arrive at 9:45Hey folks, on a phone screen right now with a data science person from PathStream - if it ends early, will try and poke my head into huddles towards the end. If not, here's my huddles update for the morning.\n\n_Yesterday_: Finally got the mathematics working for my intensive project N-dulum, meaning that I can now visualize any chaos pendulum in 2D real time space. Took quite a bit of reteaching myself differential equations and learning a new Python library, SymPy. Like most things with Python, once I figured out how to use it, I was astonished with its elegance! \n\n_Today_: Clean up my pendulum logic into OO hierarchy that can receive user input for the pendulum order. Create a command line tool for user input. And of course, visualize the damn thing. Lot of MatPlotLib and system-level Python today. \n\n_Blockers_: Nothing significant. Contacted my shins and lower leg a little harder than expected yesterday during my workout so it hurts a little today but I doubt it'll negatively impact my work.\n\n:aakash: :thumbsup_all: :make-school:I\u2019m sorry y\u2019all I stepped out early yesterday because I didn\u2019t feel well, I should have given you all notice. I\u2019ll be there this morning.This is your second no-call-no-show to huddles this week. Please show up tomorrow morning and the rest of the week or you risk not earning credit for for SPD intensive project.So you thought you wouldn\u2019t show up or communicate about it and everything would be totally fine\u2026? :unamused:I didn\u2019t have any code to review, I was dealing with an issue in one of my classes <@Aakash (Kash) Sudhakar>, <@Betsy Bailey>, and <@Johnathan Chen> (again), you didn\u2019t show up at our 4:30pm huddle. What happened?Yesterday: testing for our group project got pushed to today. So I worked on my other group project and continued working on our sprint.\n\nToday, gonna work on testing. And practice more for my google interview. Also, gonna go to a meetup at the Asana HQ :) y'all welcome to join here: <https://www.eventbrite.com/e/real-talk-finding-your-voice-in-tech-tickets-50618178334>\n\nBlockers: my health, can't seem to wake up on time: I\u2019m on my bike and almost to school. ETA ~9:35 <!group> - please check the calendar for today\u2019s huddle activity. Hey all, my morning workout destroyed my body and took a little extra naptime to recover - waking up from my nap now. Lemme share my huddle thoughts in case I don't make it on time. \n\n\nYesterday, I played around with SymPy and some advanced mathematical libraries in Python in an attempt to more easily model the simulations I'm working to model. Managed to get my double pendulum to work in less than twenty lines of code, rather than the other 300 lines it took previously. Success! Today, I'll try to implement the triple pendulum system and visualize it using MatPlotLib. No blockers as of now.I\u2019ll be running a little late to the first huddle \u2014 my PT appointment took a bit longer than usual <@Alan Davis [CS]> sorry about that ya\u2019ll I had a meeting with our sod industry partners so couldn\u2019t attend huddles. Next time I\u2019ll notify you.<@Johnathan Chen> and <@Matthew Harrilal>, you missed our huddle at 12:30pm today. What happened?Thanks for posting your standupdate here <@Erick Sanchez> and <@Jasmine Humbert>! See you at 4:30pmSorry! I won't be at the meeting today. Here's my response:\n\n1. What did you accomplish yesterday?\n\nTook a much needed break after finals.\n\n\n2. What specific goals do you want to accomplish today in programming lab?\n\nAt minimum get django admin up and running but I think I can probably have models and a view or two displaying by the end of the day.\n\n\n3. What blockers do you have that might make accomplishing those goals harder?\n\nBrain is a little foggy today so if anything hard or unexpected comes up it will take me a little longer to fix/overcome.Sorry! I won't be at the meeting today. Here's my response:\n\n1. What did you accomplish yesterday?\n\nCleared a lot of my personal tasks so I can keep this week focused on projects\n\n\n2. What specific goals do you want to accomplish today in programming lab?\n\nFinish code coverage of the following models: Beacon, Attendance, and User\n\n\n3. What blockers do you have that might make accomplishing those goals harder?\n\nBalance unexpected tasks and priorities with what I had planned at the given dayWelp. I did not check my calendar and went home to grab my forgotten lunch. I'll be either late or not present to scoping standups.How I deal with sadness- What are some things you do that always cheer you up/make you happy/put a smile on your face when you are feeling a bit down?\n- What are some constraints that disallow you from doing that?:sunny: Reminder that <@Kuan-Ying Fang> is leading our huddle <!group> today! What\u2019s the topic?Hey everyone <!here>, at a biotechy event at UCSF Mission Bay this morning so lemme share my huddle morning thoughts remotely,\n\nTerm 1 was great with getting back in the coding routine and stepping back into a system of accountability for getting work done. I thoroughly enjoyed working with the Data Science class and have had fun dabbling in side projects since then. Since there weren't many other courses I wanted/needed to take this term, this term I focused a lot more on project work, interview prep (5-15 hours per week), networking in the city (couple events per week), and balancing work-life. \n\nI think some productive struggles mainly entail ensuring that I put in time each day to work on my own data science or developer work, even if I have work to do for the DS class or my other projects. I often forget to keep my personal project streak going and more often than not commit code/resources to repos other than mine. Term 2 I'll be focusing a lot more on personal project revision and creation. \n\nIn addition, with Term 2 I want to continue working on balancing work-life demands. Balancing a professional networking schedule, Make School work, and my athletic routine was a significant challenge last term and I certainly don't anticipate it becoming easier as the months pass. One strategy I am employing is reporting out to my coach (Jeff) more regularly regarding successful and unsuccessful strategies I had the past week and what areas I can improve - more frequency and accountability on my end.Howdy <!group>! ETA ~30 seconds... :wink:\nHere\u2019s today\u2019s reflective huddle topic:\n&gt; What went well term 1? \n&gt; What were some productive struggles for you? \n&gt; What do you want to change or improve in term 2?FYI: I won\u2019t be able to participate in our huddle <!group> but here\u2019s today\u2019s topic:\n&gt;*Share something you\u2019ve written and exchange feedback with a partner.* It could be your SPD 1.1 blog post, a paper from your writing class, an email you sent to your industry contact, or another (short) piece of your writing.I\u2019ll be out of huddle today - as my replacement I present my doggos snuggling <@Novan (Donny) Adams> is going to lead today.<@Novan (Donny) Adams> is going to lead today :smile: :rainbow::raised_hands::skin-tone-5:I\u2019m on my way too, ETA ~9:40.

Some of the most difficult and stressful moments of our lives also end up being the most formative and motivating. Some of the best and most gratifying experiences of our lives are also the most distracting and demotivating. Don\u2019t trust your conception of positive/negative experiences. All that we know for certain is what hurts in the moment and what doesn\u2019t.

Rainbows were and still are one of those things that even today reflect the crazy nature of dynamic physics and how simple interactions between light, water vapor, and an observer standpoint can produce something with crazy beauty. In my mind, they rank up there in terms of beautifully exemplary acts of scientific wonder with phenomena like auroras, lightning, and comets in the night sky.I contacted Dan and he hasn\u2019t updated the huddle topic yet, so here\u2019s a custom one just for the coolest huddle <!group> ever \u2013 the Rainbow Warriors! :captain-rainbow::rainbow::crossed_swords:\n&gt;What does the rainbow mean to you?\nSee y\u2019all very soon! :bike::stopwatch::grimacing: Will also not be at huddles today, recovering from early training. I noticed the huddles question is a rehash of an earlier one - where we have growth and fixed mindsets. Is that our question for today?Hey guys I won\u2019t be at huddles today due to illness.Feel better!Its okay! Its just all handsUnder the weather today :face_vomiting:Rainbow Warriors Forever!Just wanna remind you guys that all y'all are amazing! :smile:Running late but on the way!!Don\u2019t forget, Matthew... Today\u2019s your day to shine!!! :sun_with_face::sparkles::male-astronaut::rocket::last_quarter_moon::dizzy::star2::tada:Rainbow Warriors Forever!! :tada: :alan: :rainbow: :fist::skin-tone-5: :captain-rainbow:<@Matthew Harrilal> will be leading tomorrow. Rainbow Warriors Forever!! :rainbow:I won\u2019t actually make it to our huddle today cause I need to make an important phone call before 10am. Please remember to select someone to lead tomorrow and announce it in this <!group> Am also missing huddles; I have a very important phone screening and interview this morning! Wish me luck, folks! Here's my huddle response for today.\n\nAREA WHERE I HAVE A STRONG GROWTH MINDSET: When I'm learning a new skill or trade. As a novice/beginner, I continually tell myself that over a long way to go and embrace new changes, techniques, and patterns as they come. A good example in my life is coding and data science - barely been doing either for a year and theres so much more to learn. \n\nAREA WHERE I HAVE A STRONG FIXED MINDSET THAT I WANT TO CHANGE: The converse of the above - when I'm teaching/practicing a skill I'm very fluent with and highly skilled in. It's kinda natural for me to fall into this rut of believing too much in my skill in something I've been doing for years, but I have to keep reminding myself that the more I learn, the more there is to practice and perfect. Definitely a work in progress. An example is my life is my fight training lifestyle - just does I've done it since I was a child doesn't mean I'm good enough to stop growing and learning. In fact, I need to teach myself that it means quite the opposite - that I need to be learning even more than before!Morning! :sun_with_face: Today\u2019s huddle <!group> topic:\n\n10 min read: <https://hbr.org/2016/01/what-having-a-growth-mindset-actually-means>\n\n15 min discussion: Like Anne mentioned at orientation, and the article shared, \"Individuals who believe their talents can be developed (through hard work, good strategies, and input from others) have a growth mindset. They tend to achieve more than those with a more fixed mindset (those who believe their talents are innate gifts, and lack of ability is fixed)\" We are all a mix of both mindsets.\n\n- What's an area where you have a strong growth mindset?\n- Where might you have a strong fixed mindset that you want to change?Good  morning! I will unfortunately miss huddle today.Gonna miss Huddles this morning due to a phone screening! Here's my huddle response: \n\nMy internal critic is the strongest usually during one of two occasions. \n\n1. Physical Training. Whenever I'm fight training, I'm very self-conscious about my performance, style, technique, speed, flexibility, and a bunch of other factors jumbled into the mix. Part of me thinks since I've been doing it for so long (since I was a child) that that's why I'm so critical on myself: I wanna make sure I'm always improving. Usually what I do is just push all thoughts aside and focus on the direct task at hand: training until I'm too tired to continue. My internal critic seems pretty tired then too! \n\n2. Teaching. I've instructed occasionally throughout my life, in high school classes, college clubs, training gyms, and most recently at Make School. Part of me accepts that if I teach myself something wrong, then it's just on me, but if I've taught someone else something wrong, then I've betrayed both their intellectual curiosity and their trust. I try and actively prepare, ask critical questions, and open a dialogue around challenging teaching material to avoid that as much as possible, though whenever I do ultimately screw up and teach something wrong, I feel the best way to both accept responsibility and silence that internal critic is reteach the material again with more focus and attention to detail. Thoughts?I'll be absent from huddlesI will not be making it to huddles today, I have a doctors appointment :male-doctor: See ya soon! Today\u2019s huddle <!group> topic:\n&gt; When is your internal critic the strongest? How do you deal with it?See y\u2019all at ~9:35! Today\u2019s huddle topic:\n(10 min) Call or message someone who has supported you and thank them.\nExamples:\n- Write an appreciation letter to a friend, roommate, or idol \n- Email an old friend or teacher how they\u2019ve positively influenced you\n- Call grandma tell her you love her right now\n- Apologize for something you\u2019ve done\n- Compliment someone you rarely talk to\n\n(10 min) Share ideas with the <!group>Soon as in relative soon or absolute soon?This morning\u2019s huddle presentation <https://gist.github.com/diop/651951711471b21afc34588c23a10edc>She works at the DMVSame! :runner: :bike: Friendly reminder that Fod\u00e9 is leading our huddle <!group> today. See you all soon!The DMV isnt open this early, Fang. WHO IS SHE?I just got out of the DMV and will head there asap. Might be a bit late this morning.Not going to be able to make it in today y\u2019all, one perspective that I didn\u2019t understand well prior to this huddle meeting is how people can work effectively in coffee shops! Well according to some research I found was that you have fewer options in choices such as not being able to turn on the tv or just use the bathroom casually. Spending less time on these tasks boosts your productivity. Welp, that\u2019s my spiel have a good huddle!Feel betterMe too! Today\u2019s huddle <!group> topic:\n&gt;10 min activity: What is a perspective you do not understand well? Research it for 10 minutes by finding article/blog post online and reading it. Try to understand the perspective.\n&gt;For the last ten minutes we\u2019ll share what we\u2019ve learned with the rest of the group.Going to be late as well!Will be 10min late :pensive:Woke up a tad bit late folks, am rushing to the BART now!Feel better Feel better.Hi huddle, I\u2019m not feeling well today and won\u2019t be able to make it. See you all tomorrow!Thanks for reading aloud and participating this morning! Any time you want to see my calendar to schedule/reschedule time with me, you can follow this link: <http://make.sc/alan-cal|make.sc/alan-cal> or simply add <mailto:Alan@makeschool.com|Alan@makeschool.com> in the text box on the left side of the Google Calendar web app.Since I\u2019m out (on a call rn), grabbed a link for my Calendar. I\u2019ll share my insights for Google Calendar here.\n\n<https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=YWFrYXNoLnN1ZGhha2FyQGdtYWlsLmNvbQ>\n\nI definitely think I can be using Calendar more effectively, I use it often as a retrospective rather than a planning tool. It\u2019s worked a few times for calls and meetings, but there certainly have been times where I\u2019ve been late to meetings or missed obligations with friends/coworkers entirely bc of ineffective Calendar use. I try to use the habit of adding time blocks every day regardless of what I did that day, simply so I can get in the habit.\n\nIf anyone has any feedback/questions/advice on how I can use my Calendar more efficiently, please let me know! There\u2019s plenty I can learn. :slightly_smiling_face:Today\u2019s huddle <!group> topic (in case you haven\u2019t checked the calendar event today):\n&gt;1. Read this article (10 min): _\u201cMaker\u2019s Schedule, Manager\u2019s Schedule\u201d_ (<http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html>) \u2013 an iconic post on productivity by Paul Graham, one of the founders of startup accelerator Y Combinator.\n&gt;2. Group activity (10 min): Share your Google Calendar for this week with a partner. Discuss how you manage your time and any ideas for how you could manage your time better, perhaps utilizing ideas from the article.I will be late, I\u2019m sorry y\u2019all !Got an important call today, wont be into huddles. Lemme check the calendar and post my answers to our question.<@Fode Diop>: I think you a word above :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:I\u2019m on my way but coming late.

Super fun to mingle with all parts of the Make School community including prospective students and industry friends. Everyone walked away SUPER impressed with meeting you, especially commenting on how genuine and nice you all were :blue_heart:\n\nThis was a great prototype event in \u201cThe Basement Club\u201d (as I\u2019ve been told it\u2019s been named). We\u2019re hoping to host many more events. We can design the space to be loungier, have a smaller dedicated dance area, showcase art installations, have live music performances, feature mainstream and hip hop DJs (saving my deeper music for later in the night :wink:), and maybe even a permanent ballpit? :thinking_face::white_circle::black_circle::red_circle::large_blue_circle:\n\nI\u2019m pretty excited to work with the events committee to help build culture around music and art and conscientious partying :smiley:2nd place!cross fingers28 team we are on the finale top 3 now...Good luck represent the 305!DJ T\u014dsh (AKA Ashu) is DJing<!channel> reminder that there is a party with prospective students and industry contacts tonight starting in 30m!#previewweekend :gem::raised_hands::skin-tone-3:Awesome, I went to the Emerge Americas conference and attended the hackathon closing ceremonies last year and I really wanted to go this year.

I definitely wanted to touch on that during my talk but did not find the time to fit it in.\n\nAccording to the informational site on organ donation ran by the government, <http://organdonor.gov|organdonor.gov>, the most popular myth is that people fear that if it\u2019s known that you are a donor at the hospital, they won\u2019t try to save your life. This is untrue because hospitals only exist to save your life. That is the first and main priority of a hospital. In fact, most doctors are not even informed if you are a registered donor during the help they provide. It is only really looked into when all lifesaving procedures have been tried and failed. Donation is the last resort.I've heard it wasn't good to put that you're an organ donor on your license because they don't give the same good treatment. Any truth to that <@Ryan Nguyen> Shout out to <@Mitchell Hudson [FEW]> for helping me debug at 9:00p on a Friday! Thank you!! :raised_hands: :mitchell:Hey <!here> It was a pleasure to give my lightning talk today.

We've managed to secure a `Make School Promotion Code` to *take 20% off* of the overall Spartan ticket price! That brings the original price of ~$140 down to *just under $110*! :money_with_wings: :ticket: :thumbsup_all:\n\nThis is likely one of the better deals we'll get, and base ticket prices are likely to rise over the next week, so if you're seriously interested in running the Spartan Race with your Make School Family, *please talk to me and Uchenna ASAP about the registration process*! We'll be purchasing our tickets at the next stipend disbursement! :moneybag: :heavy_check_mark:\n\nWe're setting a soft deadline for registration by `May 1st` so we can all make use of the stipend disbursement to register together, especially since the Spartan itself is on June 1! That way, we can all make sure we compete at the same time during the race as well! :woman-running::skin-tone-5: :runner::skin-tone-5: That being said, if you have any issues regarding ticket purchasing, training, or anything that may be deterring you from registering by *May 1st*, _please* talk to me or Uchenna ASAP so we can help! :handshake:\n\nFinally, if you're interested in any level or would like to follow our team's training and progress, please join the #spartan-makers channel on Slack! :slack:\n\nThanks everyone! Let's make this Spartan Race an *experience of a lifetime*! :sports_medal: :simple_smile: :make-school:Do we also need to submit proof alongside the forms?<!channel> -- Please remember that *EOD tomorrow (Friday, April 26)* is the deadline for two major things:\n\n\n1. `Health Forms:` Immunization + Checklist!\n2. `Withdrawing from Term 4 Courses` with a \"W\" grade, which requires coach approval.\n\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions!Anyone around that can help me with some computer science stuff?:b:eroku :b:pplications<!channel> If you missed the *Registration Session* today - read this update:\nOnly the courses in the table below are available for your to register for in terms 5 and 6 *unless you have prior coach approval*.  There are more courses than this in <http://make.sc/course-enrollments|make.sc/course-enrollments>, but these are open *ONLY* for students with special edge cases that have approval.RIPlolYeah, getting the same thing. The Make School dashboard can't take traffic of this magnitude.oofuhhhhh, is anyones dashboard infinitely loading?fixed!<!here> Come join me for Junior Career Lab in the Great Hall :make-school: Will be hosted in the back on the grey couch :couch_and_lamp:Hey Folks,\nGarbage disposal is inoperable at the moment. Sarah knows and is getting the maintenance people on it.<!channel>\n\nRegistration for Summer - Thursday 12-1 Great Hall :  Key things to know\n\n1. If you are not in internship, you will register for classes.  If you are in internship - make sure you have filled out the <http://make.sc/swe-registration-form|make.sc/swe-registration-form>.  Your coaches will need it to sign off your registration request.\n\n2. We will be collecting Job Readiness Data again - if you have your Job Readiness Survey from last term - be sure to bring it so you and your coach can just discuss changes.\n\n3. Before you leave the session you should have registered for Term 5 and Term 6,, filled out your Job Readiness Rubric and gotten sign off on both from your coach.  If your coach is not there, check with me for conditional course approval and to turn in your Job Readiness Rubric.Yes, there are things that DU specifically has asked of us that are not accreditation requirements and that we will have the choice of keeping or changing and once independently accredited. If you have something in mind I can clarify whether its accreditation or DU or a mix of both.Thanks <@Jeremy Rossmann [Founder]> - are there more things that DU specifically asked of MS? To confirm my understanding - is Dominican U a sort of \"umbrella\" under which MS is accredited?\n\nInterested because I'm trying to understand the factors which affect MS This is our accreditor: <https://www.wscuc.org>Doesn't necessarily have to be a MS resource Where can a student go to learn, throughly, what is required of an institution to earn Accreditation - I.e: specifically what the requirements were for Make School to be accredited? Hey, <!channel>!  This is another reminder about these important health forms. Please be aware that, while coaches will work with you and approve your course selections for Term 5 and 6 tomorrow, you are not officially registered until I...\n\n1. Receive *ALL 3* health forms from you; or\n2. You communicate about blockers preventing you from delivering me forms and give me a solid alternate deadline.\n\nI will _not_ be lenient with our Friday, April 26 deadline if you choose not to communicate with me about this.\n\n:green_heart: :jen::make-school:Hello <!here>!

This Q&amp;A session is solely to benefit you :slightly_smiling_face:Hi Fam, \n\nI hope everyone is doing well. I\u2019ve been having a really good time throughout my NASA internship experience, riding rovers, meeting Astronauts, going to training at the NBL, and a lot more. Besides the fun activities that I get to do, I\u2019ve been also working in some really cool and futuristic Machine Learning projects and now I am officially the longest lasting intern in the Data Analytics department and next semester I\u2019ll be working on a Mars 2020 Mission. \n\nI\u2019ve been connecting and meeting a lot of people and I was able to arrange a group of NASA Co-Ops to be guest speakers and to talk you all of you and gives some tips about getting an internship or a job at NASA.\n\nThere will be a video conference to highlight career opportunities and to answer any questions you may have about life at NASA on *May 2nd from 11am-12pm*. If you are interested in attending to this event, please react to this post with :rocket:. \n\nAlso, if you could comment here a few questions that you would like them to answer, so I can pass it along to them. Thank you everyone! YEah, Funny I remember the date of my Anthrax vaccinations but not all this other crap.<@Eric Botcher> I know haha. I had a doctor's appointment today so I somehow got it but that's only because I made the doctor's appointment a month ago<@Anwar Azeez> Most of these were given to you in BasicYeah Jen, VA is a pain in the Ass. A week is pretty short notice for this kind of request. Is it possible to get an extension?<@Anwar Azeez> -- Please do contact them and see. Your immunizations should be on record with them and should be easy enough to get. If you have any vaccines that you need to get, we could get you into a Walgreens or something for that.I get my medical through the veterans administration so by Friday may be impossibleThis is the checklist, which may not require more than you just checking off some important boxes.This is the form about Immunizations, which may require a doctor's help.Hey, <!channel>!\n\n\n*This is a friendly reminder that ALL health forms must be completed and submitted to be by EOD on FRIDAY, APRIL 26.* :calendar: :page_facing_up: :lower_left_ballpoint_pen: This includes the Immunization Form and Requirements Checklist, which I will attach to this thread.\n\n\nThese forms may require connecting with your doctor and/or getting required vaccinations. _*DO NOT* start this process on Friday morning, and think you'll be able to get everything in to me on time._ :syringe::male-doctor::skin-tone-3:\n\n\nNot turning these forms into me by the deadline will mean: not only will I be sad :cry: and disappointed :disappointed:, but I will also have to put a Registration Hold :no_entry: on your account. The Registration Hold is no fun. It creates extra work for everyone. You, me, instructors, coaches. And it _could_ have an impact on the courses we offer. So, let's not do that.\n\n\n&gt;A `REGISTRATION HOLD` means not being registered for Term 5 courses, and thus not being able to attend classes.\n\n\nPlease, please, please take a moment to start this process. And feel free to reach out to me with any kind of blockers you're experiencing, as I may be able to help overcome them.\n\n\n:green_heart: :jen: :make-school:Ok.

Hello <!channel>! *IMPORTANT PSA* On behalf of the Operations Team, I would like to reach out regarding the incident that happened to a student last night.\n\nFirst, as many of you are probably aware, a number of members of this San Francisco community that inhabit our local area can often be unpredictable and, while it is generally rare, threatening or even violent.\n\n1. If you see someone behaving strangely near our building at anytime, you can alert staff or if after hours call *San Francisco's non-emergency line at 415-553-0123.* They will send patrol to deal with the threat. *IF there is an immediate threat of danger do call 911*\n\n2. T *he Hotel next door is open 24/7*. We share a landlord and a close working relationship with them. I *f you feel uncomfortable or are waiting for a lyft etc in the evening,  please feel free to go into the hotel lobby* and wait. You may even speak to lobby staff as they are aware of Make School.\n\n3. Note: the new student residence is located in Nob Hill, which is a better area than previous student residences.\n\nIf you have additional concerns or questions, please *do not hesitate to reach out to me, even privately if you feel more comfortable*I'd really love it if we had some Make School pamphlets to give out. Whenever I'm at a hackathon/networking event/etc, there are always people who want more information. Also, is there any incentive for them to use a referral number? Like a waived enrollment fee?:thinking_face:what would be worthwhile for y'all? Dinner on <@Jeremy Rossmann [Founder]>?What is the incentive for a successful referral? A successful referral being a student who we refer and is accepted.<@Eric Botcher><https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DHaEX6E_c1WyFQYVN4WlRVBlTlsmpcwL1e0cvwdh7Cw/edit?usp=sharing>Hey y\u2019all <!channel>,\nWe are still accepting applicants for fall 2019 and we need your help getting the word out. I\u2019m asking each of you  to reach-out to friends, old CS teachers, clubs/organizations to let them know about Make School.\n\nAttached is a super awesome document Dan created last year with messaging and current strategies we are considering.\n\nFeel free to use as much of this messaging as you\u2019d like. You\u2019re also welcome to craft your own messaging. Please look through this document and send me any feedback. Otherwise, feel free to start blasting the word out.\n\nTo find your specific referral link. Go to <https://www.makeschool.com/dashboard>, and expand the bar with the 3 vertical dots on the top left corner of the page under the Make School logo. Your link is specific to you and will allow us to give you credit for folks who apply using your link.\n\nIf you would like to reach-out to your network, but don\u2019t want to continue the conversation, you can give folks my email(<mailto:buay@makeschool.com|buay@makeschool.com>) and redirect to me. Also feel free to send me names and contact info if you\u2019d prefer me to reach-out.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.

We shared more about it in this blog post:\n<https://medium.com/make-school/building-a-modern-university-5cdf0c817b2f>\n\nFunding announcements are often exciting to the media and public because they serve as validation for an idea or organization that\u2019s still in early stages of development. It\u2019s important to keep in mind that the funding is simply a means to an end, enabling us (both staff and students) to continue to work towards our mission of building a new university founded on progressive values.\n\nThere won\u2019t be any major changes in the near term as a result of the new funding (the funding actually closed back in December). We\u2019ve been thoughtful to work with investors who are deeply supportive of our mission and believe in quality high touch education, so we don\u2019t have significant external pressure to grow faster than we\u2019re comfortable doing. Though you can expect a larger number of students in the building next year as we hire a few more instructors and polish up the downstairs space.\n\nIn the medium to long term, the funding will help us explore a few growth opportunities. Some ideas we\u2019re considering are: CS adjacent degrees like computation biology, a masters program, an NYC campus, and powering CS minors at more colleges. All of these are still in the idea phase, so we\u2019ll plan to do more research and get your feedback before we commit to anything.\n\nAs always, let us know if you have any questions or feedback!\n\nCheers,\nAshu and JeremyHey, <!here>! *Let's talk pronouns. Mine are they / them / their.* As in, \"Jen loves to sing karaoke, and Fiona Apple is one of their go-to musical artists.\" :musical_note: :microphone: Or \"Jen loves pizza, we should share a slice with them because they're super cool!\" :pizza: :sunglasses:\n\n*ProTip:* When meeting someone for the first time, you might say something like, \"Hi, I'm Jen, and I go by they / them pronouns. How should I refer to you?\" Keep in mind that offering your own pronouns (or asking for another's pronouns) is not a social misstep, but forcing people to share is a definite no-no. _Consent applies here, too!_For those of you that are interested to write Python code for Raspberry pi hardware:\n<https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects?software%5B%5D=python>Hey, <!here>! *I'm holding office hours in the Great Hall today from 10am to 11:30am.* If you have college questions (academic advising, requests for documentation, queries about policies and procedures), I'm here for ya!The few people who got seats could get refunded and we can try again for next week.

Once all of the points have been tested against all of the others, I would then return the length of the set. You don\u2019t need to test two points that share either an x or a y coordinate. Also the same square will be tested twice given that a square has four vertices and you\u2019re testing all of the vertices against each other so... you need to figure out a way of testing if a square has already been tested and then store that square just once within the set...If it's just visual, it would probably have to be broken into smaller pieces and put into a two-dimensional array, where it would give each component with lines surrounding it a '1' and everything else a '0' (so the top-left square would be a [1,1,1,1] because it has lines surrounding all four sides). The bigger ones would be more difficult, but I'm thinking it would check if a '1' in one array bordered another '1' in a different one, if this was true on each side, and if the number of '1's was even or not.14What\u2019s the input? An array of xy coordinates?O.oHow many squares do you see?\n\n\nCan we write a function that finds number of squares? \n\n<!channel> :calendar: *TERM 4 SCHEDULE IS NOW SHIPPED!!* :ship: :dani:\n:eyes: _Please check your calendar and DM me if you notice any mistakes!_Sorry, that should be fixed now! <@Ansel Bridgewater>The document seems to be view only.Hi everyone, a couple of students at Make School were generous enough to offer to pitch in to purchase books for all of us (huge S/O to them).

This feels a little bit more ergonomic for someone around my height (5'5\").\n- With the _white chairs_ (all three types) the tables seem to work well.\n\n*Cons:*\n- The legs of the table might not be very comfortable for taller students.\n- If we're gonna be using them with the _computer chairs_ that we currently have, they might not be very compatible.The tables are fine. I like that there is a foot rest when sitting at the top or bottom of the trapezoid, but it is a bit uncomfortable when sitting at one of the sides of the trapezoid because of how the table legs are placed.:scream: Can they be arranged in the MS M in every classroom:pray:SHOUTOUT TO <@Ansel Bridgewater> FOR GETTING ME UNBLOCKED\u201cplease reply here\u201d =&gt; *on this thread*FYI: <http://make.sc/stackoverflow|make.sc/stackoverflow> :make-school::link::wink:Hey everyone!

Basically wrapping all things tech and STEM-related into a big umbrella and having schools compete with one another!\n\nDefinitely helped spark a big curiosity about coding and software that I ended up exploring years later. Saw a lot of my peers play around with Java, C, and other languages at the time and found it interesting. I'm sure there are schools in the Bay area involved in TSA! For me the robotics club was doing things in Java ... that wasn't the start of my path into programming but was a place where I found some HS coders.Hey y\u2019all,\n\nQuick crowd source: What clubs, events, or programs were you involved in or know of that you would recommend for high school students interest in CS? Or things that helped you figure out CS was an interest.Yeah, there\u2019s a lot of dialog going on about legacy and access to SAT tutors. People don\u2019t tend to question systems unless they\u2019ve really studied them.I'm honestly just surprised that so many people are surprised. I think it's something like half of Harvard's admits have families connected to the school.Hey folks!\n\nIn light of the college admissions scandal, there\u2019s a handful of reporters looking to write deeper stories on the admissions practices of top colleges.\n\nThey are looking to connect with students or parents who fit the following categories:\n\n1. Those who didn\u2019t gain admission to top colleges (and have an opinion about it)\n\n2. Those who did gain admission to a top college but chose another path (eg. Make School)\n\nIf you fit this profile and are interested / willing to talk to reporters on the topic of college admissions, shoot me a DM.\n\nThere\u2019s absolutely no pressure to make any aggressive statements, and we can help prep you for any reporter calls if they decide to take us up on it. We\u2019re mostly interested in advancing the dialog of how to create a more inclusive and equitable college admissions process!<!here> building open to students till 5 todayYes, open everyday this week from 9-5.

Maybe 1 or 2 teams has been putting in the work that it takes to complete this course.  SPD is not an easy course, and you can\u2019t finish it without large dedicate times with everyone present. Since we are 5 weeks in now with only 2 to go, most teams will need to put in a ton of time to pass.\n\n*RECOMMENDATION* - Unless teams setup at least *2 x 6 hour warrooms per week until the end of the term*, I doubt more than 40% of teams will get credit for the course. If you do setup these warrooms, attend them and work hard, then maybe, MAYBE, you will have enough time to create a project that will earn you a pass SPD, and more importantly will be a contribution to your portfolio and something you can be proud of.\n\nA \u201cwarroom\u201d is where everyone on one team goes to one room and works for an extended period of time. If you are not holding at least a 2 x 6 hour warrooms per week, there is NO WAY you could be spending enough time to complete this project successfully.\n\nPlan 1-2 warrooms per weekend, and then 1-2 that goes from 3pm-9pm at Make School during the week.hey \u2014 does anyone have a usb to usb C converter?Update: The bevi machine has been serviced, it's good to go again!Lols, figured as much :joy:That calendar also says there's a 29th :thinking_face:<!channel> I erased NO SCHOOL on Thursday Feb. 28th from the Great Hall calendar.

Don\u2019t beat yourself for it, it happens. Also, there is no shame in that and I bet that a lot of people in our school could relate to that. I honestly think that the support group idea is really great, I know that Betsy mention that she also wanted to do something similar, like an accountability/support group, maybe you could talk to her and make that really happen, I\u2019m sure a lot of people would benefit from it.<@Briant (Elliot) Oliveira> I am as well. I had never done so until a few months ago through the VA. It was definitely one of the best decisions I've made.\n\nAlthough at times it's embarrassing to admit, I have pretty severe depression, disassociation episodes(not multiple personality), ptsd(non military related) and whatnot. So it's been rather hard to fix it all, so I come off as a dick sometimes, although it's completely unintentional. I get pretty bad anger, although mostly I have had severe irritation due to the SSRI I've been taking not working well for me, so I have to transition off that to a new one.\n\nSo I've had a little less patience than I should, which I do see it affect how I may interact with others. I was meaning to make a support group with Dan at the beginning of the year, but we never found a good time and the idea just kind of died. Kind of like a safe place for people to just vent their problems in a supportive and private environment.\n\nSince seeking mental health care is often pushed to the back of peoples priorities. I still think that would be beneficial for most students though, maybe I'll look into it again with Dan.<!here> Happy Martin Luther King Day! Take this day to reflect on what equality means and how we can all take steps forward to make this world so much better than what it was in the past.Rah! <@Jayce Azua> this is not the place for this. This is the kinda shit that scares people and it only exacerbates negative stereotypes of war veterans. Stereotypes which make it less likely for people to hire us because they think we\u2019re crazy. This isn\u2019t about you, or your dead homies, it\u2019s about your living homies who are trying to get jobs. \n\nIf you need to talk about some shit I\u2019m here for you man. But don\u2019t make your shit, other people\u2019s shit.<@Asim Zaidi> Honestly if he\u2019s gonna call me out like this in front of the entire school, Imma reply right here in front of the entire school.\n\nY\u2019all can all stop tagging me in stuff bc I\u2019m ignoring all of it from here on out. Happy MLK JR DAY :hugging_face:<@Nyapal Gatkuoth [RA]> love you but you can\u2019t be saying bogus things like this in the general slack channel y\u2019all DM each other your feelings lol :man-facepalming: but then again several people here tweaking so yeah nobody\u2019s wrong :grinning:<@Anwar Azeez> I\u2019m truly glad that you made the decision to seek for help. Like I said, if you ever need anything feel free to reach us.It's cool, I see my therapist once a week and psychiatrist every other lmao. \n\nBut thanks! <@Anwar Azeez> awesome! I really hope that they can help solve this conflict. Also, if you ever need to talk or anything at all don\u2019t hesitate in reaching out to the student council, after all that\u2019s one of the reasons that we are there.I've already reached out regarding this. Also I was voicing my opinion about others voicing their opinion, so is my opinion somehow now invalid because it contradicts others opinions?\n\nI'm not saying that people can't hold that opinion, I'm just giving mine on it. I don't think nor do I expect others to agree with me and I am simply neutral with that. In the end he wasn't using it to share an opinion, he was using it to let others know to be careful around school because we're all getting sick. That's not an opinion, it's a fact and the flu can actually be quite serious.\n\nIf you don't care for what he said, that's your perogative. It clearly wasn't directed at you, therefore if people just decided not to break down why he used something to say something and cause a barrage of side threads just on that fact, nothing would have happened. \n\nIt's seems rather hypocritical that some people can have an opinion on certain somethings while others cannot?\n\n\nMoreso people are ganging up on someone, where it is literally always the same people, who decide to be the @ channel warriors almost exclusively for the meme, which makes it even more annoying. \n\n\nIf you have an issue with the @, message them privately otherwise bring it up with the school if you have a problem.\n\nRiddle me this, how much time out of your day did it take you to be like hmm oh, somebody @'ed the channel? \n\nI literally have all my notifications on and I barely notice when it happens. I come back to the little red numbers and am like oh okay well I don't care what they were and I press the x and they all disappear. Regardless of how important or dumb the @ was. \n\nThere's a reason why my resting heart rate is 50bpm and it's not because I excercise, it's because I don't get offended by remedial crap that literally doesn't affect my life whatsoever.\n\nSometimes when somebody uses @ channel, they are doing so because they personally find it necessary and then others decide to unnecessarily nitpick.\nI also wasn't projecting, I don't get \"Up in arms\" over this whole thing.\n\nI just find it rather pointless when people get offended by it. Which even though how I said it was a clear exaggeration which I'm assuming you didn't catch, people do make a deal out of it and it's really stupid. \n\nWhat does it actually do? Nothing? Because people are still going to do it when they feel necessary, regardless of how much it may personally annoy you. \n\nIn the end, both sides don't care. You don't care, I don't care, they don't care. \nPeople just find the smallest excuses to be catty.<@Anwar Azeez> this is totally a valid argument, and I understand that. I definitely agree that <@Jayce Azua> initial post had no means to harm,whether his tone was appropriate or not (well this will an endless discussion which as you can see above has been going on and on). As probably one of the person that knows him the longest, I can truly say that under his toughness he has definitely a soft skin, and just like everyone else he has things that he needs to work on. \n\nIn term of <@Nyapal Gatkuoth [RA]>\u2019s comment... maybe we could\u2019ve all handled this situation differently, but this is a discussion we can all have with the students experience, after all this is one of <@Megan Dias> <@Caroline Virani [StuEx]> domains. \nAll I am saying is that there\u2019s other ways that we can solve conflicts and that if we keep going on and on it won\u2019t take us anywhere. Again, I\u2019m not trying to invalidade the way you feel and I truly apologize if her comment made you feel some type of way, after all Make School is supposed to be a safe space regardless of the circumstances. I\u2019ve been working really hard along with with student council to ensure that, specially because I also know other students that has been victims of rape, domestic violence, and that has suffered from other types of abuse and etc... We all have gone through some rough situations. But we can all agree the general channel shouldn\u2019t be a place to have this discussion.\n\nAlso, I think that we should all have a chat on all hands about the way we feel when students or staff uses the @ channel here. Maybe we can find ways to get in an agreement when is necessary to use it or not.Clearly this is not going anywhere...Can we just accept that there was a miss communication in both parties and move on? I don\u2019t think arguing about \u201cwho is right or wrong\u201d will solve anything at this point.@jacye, you are literally the most disrespectful person at Make School. If your intent was to be helpful you wouldn\u2019t have wrote a message with that tone. I\u2019ve been through some rough shit in my life too &amp; I don\u2019t use that as an excuse to be a jerk to people. Use your two chairs discount code &amp; grow up.I can\u2019t see how your response relates to what I said. I edited my comment to be more clear just in case.If one of the staff used the at channel to notify people of the influenza going around, nobody would have said a word. \nI'm assuming you deleted your original post and re posted the same thing to keep my comment off of it, but I think it was appropriate and will re post what I said here:\n\nI think really what needs to happen is that people need to realize that all Jayce was doing was telling people to be careful and we are all getting sick with the ACTUAL flu. \n\nThen people have a shit fit with him using @ channel and then go off on him, mock him, so clearly he's not going to take it lightly. \n\nNobody cares if people don't like his approach. What he said was not wrong and Nyas comment about us and the military things was actually really rude and unnecessary. I do believe that there really shouldn't be any reason for drama as it helps nothing but really, what Jayce did was not wrong and what Nya said was also quite offensive. Even if it doesn't seem like it to you. \n\nFor all you know one of us was discharged for being raped, or the countless other likely reasons why many service members are discharged for reasons other than just serving their contract. Which can trigger memories of horrible things that happened to them in the military.\n\nClearly most people won't be aware of that and how it may be problematic to say, but it is. \n\nThe fact that several of these kids like to make a joke of everything and mock other students when they make a serious and or completely valid point, is quite frankly, ridiculous.\n\nThere doesn't need to be a barrage of \"is this really necessary for an @????\"  Like when does that ever produce a thoughtful and appropriate response. Rather than just gathering a bunch of immature hecklers who egg it on.\n\"Durmerge\" and other things like that, how does that possibly help anything other than just instigate things.OK so can we not do this again yall? No excuses, or your \"reasons\" for going off on ppl are going to cut it. This isn't the time or the place for it and as Make School students you should hold yourselves to higher standards than what we all have been subject to here. More than a few of you should be embarrassed of yourselves for how this devolved and frankly need to grow up. This isn't how a community like ours should compose itself.Lucia literally he was doing it to make sure people are careful around school because we are all getting Influenza. \nIt's important and the fact that most people can't see that, blows my mind.\n\nHow you think I'm projecting, I have no idea. Although I have my opinion, yes. Y'all really take the @ thing far too seriously. \n\nIt's an app. Get over it. \n\nI understand that YOU may not find it worthy of an @ channel but others DO.\nTherefore it's completely warranted especially considering that some people here may not be aware of the flu going around so they themselves can take proper precautions or if they have it, stay home or at least wear a mask and use sanitizer. \n\nAll I've really come to learn is that nobody cares that I don't think it's a big deal, which is fine. \nBut people constantly like to say how much they dislike it, but never want to hear someone else say it's literally no big deal.\n\n\nI'm probably repeating myself but I'll say it again,\nJust because you don't think it's important, doesn't mean it isn't.I'm not projecting lmao \nI think really what needs to happen is that people need to realize that all Jayce was doing was telling people to be careful and we are all getting sick with the ACTUAL flu. \n\nThen people have a shit fit with him using @ channel and then go off on him, mock him, so clearly he's not going to take it lightly. \n\nNobody cares if people don't like his approach.

We are working diligently to get this in place but it will take some time as we must go through a lot of formal process.  We will keep you updated and let you know as soon as options open up. Also would like to know about scholarships and FAFSA given the school's recent accreditationThis message was deleted.I don't like being @'d if it's not something that I need to know about urgently. I don't know about you all, but I eventually read all of my unreads. Specifically being @'d in <#C1D3YFP6G|general> makes it seem like something important regarding the school.Bread??Lets all make sure to get this bread next week :)Slack is a medium for communication, and to do that effectively among ~170 people requires a common set of ground rules and norms that the whole community can work with. You have your opinion on what those should be, and that\u2019s great, but the voices of other Make School students are just as valuable. I think you\u2019re doing a bit of projection here Anwar. No one was \u201cup in arms\u201d, and it\u2019s really not cool to tell people who have opinions about using at-channel that they need to stop voicing their opinion. Taking the position that it\u2019s common courtesy to not to ping the whole channel unless it\u2019s absolutely necessary is valid. wew That comment about going back to the military is also quite ignorant. You don't know why either of us left and you shouldn't really comment on that for any person who is no longer in the military.\n\nThat may be triggering, among other things. Yes, Jayce shouldn't have been so agressive with his response. \nJust agree to disagree and call it a day. It's fine.Honestly, the hostility from both sides needs to stop. Can y\u2019all go back to the military? :wave:Hai, Vinnie! :smile:I'm pretty sure the fact that Jayce decided to let others know to be careful, versus the actual child's mocking him, shows who's actually being immature here. \n\nWhat he said was relevant and important. \nPeople need to stop being such babies about things tbhwell, good afternoon everyone!It's super obvious &amp; honestly the biggest child here is youI can confirm that I am also incredibly ill and am going to see a doctor today. You really need to work on your deliveryThere is a reason but people treat @'ing the channel like some huge inconvenience. \n\nLiterally I barely even notice when someone does. Obviously if it's being abused, that's one thing. There are without a doubt reasons for using it. Influenza isn't something to scoff at. I had my flu shot and I still got it. \n\nInfluenza weaks your immune system and makes you more susceptible to other illnesses which can be life threatening. Hell, I literally went to the e.r today because I passed out from my fever. <@Jayce Azua>'s message was warrented, tons of people including myself are feeling really sick, and that affects everyone so we all need to calm down, drink medicine, stay hydrated, and wash our hands !!Like I said to many children running around placing their snot around. It\u2019s an important message. To be honest, the fact that every gets up in arms over the at channel is just ridiculous. \n\nStop complaining that you got a notification, seriously. That's great! Thank you. Sheer late night curiosity was the driving force behind my query.Considering it's the actual flu going around, yes. Hey, be careful with using the at channel, because mods can always disable it.I am verified with influenza probably from someone while at Lyft. So if you feel down, maybe stay home this week.Was it necessary to tag the channel? <!channel>\n:rotating_light: CDC IMMINENT DANGER PSA! :rotating_light:\nIf you are sick please be cautious of where you place your germs \ud83e\udda0 don\u2019t be reckless and get others sick.

As some of you may know, this is my last week at Make School. I will be joining NASA\u2019s Johnson Space Center as a Software Engineer and Data Scientist intern for a few months.\nI will be available via Slack, if anyone needs help with anything, feel free to hit me up. I will definitely miss you all, but I\u2019ll be back soon. :heart::male-astronaut::rocket::make-school:<@Thomas Vandegriff [MOB]> has joined the channelHey all. Great questions. In addition to Jeremy giving a Q&amp;A for ISA - we\u2019ll continue to add clarity to student documentation so you have full information. Thanks! <@Dylan Finn> <@James Rezendes> <@Edwin Cloud> <@Joe Rezendes><@Edwin Cloud> I love that someone had a problem that you created an API to solve. That's the true spirit of makeschool!<@Anisha Jain> I made api that converts images to base64, might be helpful? <https://avatarmate.herokuapp.com/>Should work in vanilla javascript. I\u2019m sure Dylan\u2019s way works too```\n//Create an instance of the javascript FileReader\nlet reader = new FileReader();\n//Read the GIF file\nreader.readAsDataURL(gifFile);\n//The below will execute once the GIF is read by the reader\nreader.onloadend = function() {\n  //reader.result contains the base 64 gif data\n  let base64Gif = reader.result;\n}\n```if you're getting if from user input, the express-fileupload node package can turn it into an acceptable base64 buffer with .data.  You can also capture a bitmap with the built in fs node package and use readFileSync to convert to a bitmap, and then try encoding with .toString('base64')<@James Rezendes> okay, thanks!! :)<@Anisha Jain> yeah I did some of this before. Lemme get home first and I\u2019ll help you <@James Rezendes> May be able to help you.Does anyone know how to either display this type of (GIF?) image data on a webpage using html/javascript OR how to convert this to a base64 string?Will get back to folks shortly on the latest guidance for ISA and taxes/Medi-Cal filings. \n\nWe see all the money you pay Vemo. Vemo is not a financial institution, they don\u2019t fund us in any way, they administer the contracts and collect payments for us. They charge a fixed fee per student for this. Every month they wire us the money that they collect. \n\nThe \u2018funding amount\u2019 is the $$ amount Make School is providing you to study at Make School (ie you\u2019d pay that amount in cash if you didn\u2019t take ISA). Vemo does not pay us that funding amount, remember that they pay us nothing, we pay them to collect payments for us and they pass those payments along when they get them. \n\nSounds like a 2019 ISA Q&amp;A would be a good idea :) I\u2019m sure there\u2019s more questions. \n\n <@Chloe Darsch [Staff]> can you work will college team to make that happen this month ideally?<@Jeremy Rossmann [Founder]> <@Anne Spalding>I'd love to hear what someone from Make School has to say about this.\nI'd also like to know if when we start paying our ISA's does Make School see any percentage of what we send to Vemo?

These rights are detailed in what's called the Family Educational Rights &amp; Privacy Act of 1974 (or FERPA), which is a federally-mandated regulation. Colleges are required to inform you of these rights, and also to gather permissions for release of information, every year.\n\nNow that we are officially partnered with Dominican University, the time to notify you of these rights has arrived! I have created an Annual Notice and Release Form, linked below; the first section of this document gives details about the regulation, and subsequent sections give you the opportunity to indicate what circumstances in which you want to release information.\n\n*Please take a moment to review and fill out this form: <https://goo.gl/forms/hcMygjgiPzKCd4hA3>.

Mine fell off of the rack between when that photo was taken and EOD. Guitar stands such as this one are more commonly used for those purposes: <https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Folding-Acoustic-Electric-Guitars/dp/B018FCZKR2/ref=sr_1_4?s=musical-instruments&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1543290897&amp;sr=1-4&amp;keywords=guitar+stand>Hey all! We are announcing our accreditor approval tomorrow and expect some press to come out.\n\nA few requests:\n\nIf an article comes out that you like, we\u2019d appreciate it if you shared it. It\u2019s the most helpful thing you can do. \n\nIf there are comments or questions about what\u2019s it\u2019s like to be a student here, feel free to chime in! Consider paying special care to using a respectful tone and good grammar since you will be seen as representative of our school. \n\nIf there are skeptical or negative comments or content in an article, it happens! It is generally not productive to jump in and defend us because it risks starting flame wars. In particular please don\u2019t attack people who attack us. There will always be skeptics and negativity. \n\nIf you spot something factually incorrect in an article, unfortunately that\u2019s common. Do PM me though so we can reach out and try to get it fixed. I can remember *one* article *ever* coming out about us that was fully correct on the first go *since 2012*, so again this is unfortunately super common. Did you know that the original Forbes 30 under 30 text about us said that *one million* (?!?) students had attended Make School on ISA?! We frantically reached out to them and they corrected it before most of you woke up. Such is the state of journalism these days and correctly reporting on our accreditation is also a pretty complicated thing. ok :ok_hand:Stephanie this is 100% hilarious and I love itLol, that was the Front End Tutorial. I'm not really trying to sell anyone's shoes. I hope ppl don't think that.the next time someone asks me what make school is I'm going to say that we're a shoe shopthis is a great photo.Please also do this for the shoe rack. I have tripped due to the shoes not being in empty cubbies before. Serious safety hazard.<!here> Hello everyone! The door will be locked at 5:30 but thanks to a student closer the building will be open until 7:30 tonight :smiley:<!here> PSA to please use the skateboard rack. Not only are the skateboards damaging the walls, floorboards but it is a serious safety hazard to leave them in a position where someone could trip on them.

Thank you to everyone who came out, cooked and cleaned up :turkey::maple_leaf::tada:Beyond thankful for this Make School family! :heart::blue_heart:Happy thanksgiving!!I don't think it make much sense for me to dual boot, and I I've got all the BestStuff:tm: of Linux w/ MacOS and snazzy apps which I can't get on Linux. Not to mention I've disabled system integrity protection.I'd be happy to hang out in the MS Admits channel and answer incoming student question about what operating system they should bring.I've been using linux mint for about a year now. You can dual-boot so you have both windows and linux on the same machine.i wanna switch but i like Sketch :disappointed:<@Jasmine Humbert> when did you start coding? i think linux would further complicate the already complicated process of getting ready to code on an actual computer (installing langs, tools, etc)I've been using only linux since the second week of classes and haven't been blocked because of it once.Yes but we could get them with Dominican\u2019s emails already :wink:do I smell...spotify student discounts? :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:Jesus...lmfaooodisclosure I probably say this bc I wrote code on Windows for three years before switching to Mac and in the process lost all my projects as a result of not being aware of this fundamental differenceFor what it's worth - Windows unnecessarily overcomplicates the actions surrounding the writing of any sort of code simply by not being a unix based system (as a result of some savage business finesse by Bill Gates - <https://www.quora.com/If-macOS-and-Linux-are-based-on-Unix-then-what-is-Windows-based-on-and-why-was-it-implemented-like-this-by-Bill-Gates>). That being said I'm of the opinion that something can be done to ease the financial burden...\n\nEncourage and permit Hackintosh-es (probably not good for MS in the eyes of Apple, and idk what that might mean)? \n\nIf enough students care we slash things like Swag and instead help people pay for Macs? \n\nAdmins rearrange MS budget to help students pay for Macs? \n\nWe convince Apple to give us Macs to give to others? \n\nMS buys Macs for cheap overtime from wherever they can and resells to you (for a bit more, so if someone doesn't show up they make money) if you commit to the program x days prior, once you get there you get paid out the difference of what you paid minus the purchase price? Incentivizes early lock ins which I'm guessing helps MS stay afloat\n\nIt's def worth exploring how much of an issue this is to incoming stu-s ya feelOh good feedback!<@Miki Nomura [Marketing]> <@Devery Doran [Admissions]>Before the next wave of people go through the application process, I think it should be clarified that macbooks are only really required for the mobile track.

If we do Don Rags during the winter intensive (week of January 7\u201311), we could use a very similar schedule with relatively minor changes.a very similar schedule can likely be used at a later date so its not an entirely wasted effortapologies to Alan and all the time he spent struggling with the Don Rags schedules<!channel> *IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT*\n*Make School Campus Closed Monday 11/19th- Friday 11/23*\n\nHello everyone,\n\nAs you know, California is continuing to suffer the effects of multiple devastating wild fires, and the air quality continues to hover in the unhealthy zone. In light of these circumstances and in the interest of protecting the health of our students and staff, the Make School campus will be closed next week Monday 11/19 - Friday 11/23. Make School staff encourages you to use this opportunity to go home for the whole holiday, if possible.\n\n*NOTE FROM YOUR INSTRUCTORS:* Don Rags will be rescheduled to later in the term or early in the spring.  Instructors will be available online Monday and Tuesday for code reviews, office hours, and other support for your classes.  Individual instructors will provide more information to their classes.\n\nPlease limit your time outside, and rest assured, staff will be online and available should you need support.\n\nIf you have any further questions or concerns, please let me or student experience know!We have mandatory attendance at Make School on Fridays. Unconferences and student lead huddles. Hi all - we are working on notification to MS - based on the DU text and email you just received.Friday is only S&amp;L <@Luc Boettner> - I don\u2019t think so because Friday Dominican canceled and then right after Make School canceled as well.Only for S&amp;L classes <!channel>  does this apply to us as well? <@Kendra Moore>: I have you listed as having taken BEW 1.2 with Dani, FEW 1.1 with Mitchell, and Braus as your coach. Anything incorrect here?I had a course last year with that instructor, so maybe that is why they were included?<@Kendra Moore>: That could be an error. :grimacing: Did you drop a course with that instructor?What if you have an instructor listed, but you did not take a course with them and they are not your coach?Sometimes an instructor is skipped when there are enough others there to talk about a student. Otherwise, I\u2019d be in 97 Don Rags!Basically. The green numbers indicate how many courses you took with that instructor based on a zillion `CountIf()` spreadsheet formulas calculated from our grade book.I'm guessing that's how many nice things they have to say? I have no clue honestly<@Edwin Cloud>: Do you have a hypothesis?What do the green blocks with numbers on the right mean?is the algo on github tho?:drum_with_drumsticks::drums::drum_with_drumsticks: _At long last, announcing\u2026_ :drums::drum_with_drumsticks::drums:\n\n:confetti_ball::tada::confetti_ball: *The Don Rags Schedule!* :tada::confetti_ball::tada:\n:make-school::link::calendar: <http://make.sc/don-rags-schedule-2018|make.sc/don-rags-schedule-2018> \u2013 _hot-off-the-press!_ :hotsprings::newspaper:\n\n:calendar::white_check_mark: Please review the schedule and *add your time slot to your calendar with an alarm notification*. :iphone::alarm_clock:\n:star::arrow_right: *It\u2019s very important that you DO NOT ARRIVE LATE OR MISS YOUR SCHEDULED TIME*, as that would reflect poorly on your professionalism and it\u2019s very challenging to have to reschedule these 4-5 person meetings.

See here information on face masks to protect yourselves and your health:\nEssential notes on How to Choose the Correct Mask to Protect Your Lungs\n\u2022\t Choose a mask called a \u201cparticulate respirator\u201d that has the word\n\u201cNIOSH\u201d and either \u201cN95\u201d or \u201cP100\u201d printed on it. These are sold at many\nhardware and home repair stores and pharmacies.\n\u2022\t Choose a mask that has two straps that go around your head. DO\nNOT choose a mask with only one strap or with straps that just hook\nover the ears.\n\u2022\t Choose a size that will fit over your nose and under your chin. It should seal\ntightly to your face. These masks do not come in sizes that fit young children.\n\u2022\t Do not use bandanas (wet or dry), paper or surgical masks, or tissues held\nover the mouth and nose. These will not protect your lungs from wildfire\nsmoke.\n\nMORE DETAILS: <https://www.placer.ca.gov/Departments/Air/InfoAndEducation/~/media/apc/documents/WildfireSmoke/FaceMasks-FiltersInfo.ashx>\n\nWHERE to buy:\n<https://sf.curbed.com/2018/11/9/18079866/fire-smoke-face-mask-find-oakland-san-francisco>\n\nAmazon also has many options (even ones with different colors/patterns, here is just one example: <https://www.amazon.com/3M-Particulate-Respirator-Respiratory-Protection/dp/B07JX4XZ27/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1542316127&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=particulate+respirator+mask+for+smoke>\n\nJust remember the above guidelines when searching<@Victoria Murray> we are so grateful to you for creating and keeping the space for us :sparkling_heart:I am grateful for all of you students and staff.

If you're curious what courses will be available next term or next year, you can look at the *Tentative Course Schedule*  (<http://make.sc/tentative-course-schedule|make.sc/tentative-course-schedule>).  This is an evolving document so not every course is scheduled yet.\n2. The course load and academic progress requirements (<http://make.sc/academic-progress|make.sc/academic-progress>) have been clarified in the course catalog (<http://make.sc/degree-path|make.sc/degree-path>).  Make sure to read.\n3. Students who wish to register for a course load that differs from the academic progress requirements in any term must meet with their coach and fill out the Academic Requirements Deferment Form (<http://make.sc/academic-deferment-form|make.sc/academic-deferment-form>).\n4.  All students must enroll in Dominican - it is the same as enrolling in Make School as of January.  If you have not yet gotten all of your data to Jen for enrollment, please do so ASAP.\n\nThe slides from the meeting give some visuals to the above. <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sBp6aClZSitQzUpepaUz5y8auXp0cw2aFukijdTav40/edit#slide=id.g47eb979110_0_0>I\u2019ll be leaving SF on the 15thyes! sorry for the confusion<@Colleen Ni>: Are you gone Tuesday?I checked downstairs and nobody was there\u2026 When ready for photos, please let me know!!I need to leave by 4pm on Monday!I will not be able to attend either days as my flight leaves earlier than Monday I will leaving to Ohio via flight on Friday November 14th.

Plastics and other things are burning along with other natural substances.Ah meant to do this yesterday. Thanks for the reminder! &gt;The Air Quality Index (AQI) for SF is in the 160s, (which is Beijing's average, and broken down in the article below)\n&gt;\n&gt;TLDR: Every day you breath in AQI 160 air takes about an hour off your life expectancy. Wear an N95-rated mask - or don't, knowing that!\n&gt;\n&gt;A day of AQI 160 smoke is comparable to one sixth of a nicotine cigarette. But industrial smoke pollution comes from burning tar, not nicotine, which is far worse for you and thus directly analogous to 40 cigarettes a day.

It also makes it easy to aim your stream of discarded liquids. Simply grasp your appendage, and point it in such a way that the stream goes inside the bowl attached to the wall. That is where the stream of liquid goes. Not the floor. So for the sake of everyone's socks and long pants, please practice aiming before utilizing the urinal.

I will be locking the door whenI leave today at 5, however, a very kind student volunteer will be staying on and closing at 8 p.m. :smiley: :make-school:New channel: <#CDPHH6EE7|letter-to-the-editor>\n\nPurpose: Share your thoughts and feedback on Make School communications (emails, blog posts, etc) to help us catch mistakes, improve poorly worded phrases, and overall hold us to a high standard in how we represent the school and the students.I made a channel called: <#CDNTXPLPJ|whoshiring>\n\ni felt that we had no channels for this specific topic so join that one to post about job openings!<@Briant (Elliot) Oliveira> We\u2019ll add a new channel by the end of the day for us to have a great place for feedback about improving make school communications. We absolutely want students to feel that we are representing them and their achievements to the greater community in a way that makes all of us look as awesome as we are and stands up to our shared values. Hi <@Jordan Arnesen [Admissions]> valid point and I agree 100%. I think that a channel for these kinds of concerns would be very helpful. And I\u2019ll take full responsibility on my actions. I will also delete my previous post, so there is no further discussions.Can we pin this reminder?<@Dylan Finn> all i\u2019m saying is: there are campus visits all the time throughout the year. apple has been here in the past, they might come again later this year, who knows? but you can\u2019t act like MS is being misleading with their statements when the school year has just started.<@Tia (TJ) King> You are correct!  \"Sends\" doesnt imply present tense, it is literally the tense of the word.  The word \"habitual\" would seem to imply multiple times though, and I haven't seen that either.  I express my opinion, but many of us are also swamped in work and don't have spare time to throw at problems like this.Speaking of, plastic bags are not recyclable at make school. Throw them out! (or better yet, reuse them)\n\nAlso, if theres food waste on your recyclable item, clean it off in the sink, else it can similarly be thought of as contaminatedFor the record: Make School has 66 alumni working in industry with an $95k average starting salary. 3 alumni at Google, more than any company who employs our alumni.\nSource: <https://www.makeschool.com/computer-science/outcomes/data>Me too.\n\nLet me try to drill this in further:\nIf you put trash in the compost bin, they will throw the whole compost batch into the TRASH, since its contaminated and is not considered compost.\n\nIf you put trash in the recycling bin, they will throw the whole recycling batch into the TRASH, since its contaminated and is not considered recycling.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to bother, at least throw it in the trash. This way you don\u2019t completely undo the attempts to separate these things.ya\u2019ll better start caring about the environment<@Briant (Elliot) Oliveira> if the companies are partnered with our school, and the engineers that they work with come from those companies\u2026that\u2019s the same thing essentially.also <@Dylan Finn> \u201csends\u201d doesn\u2019t only imply present tense. it also implies habitual action.  :wink:Believe me when I say that the staff here at Make School is 100% all about truth and transparency. Seeing that you care about those values too is awesome. However, your original post conveys a lack of faith and trust that we are on the same page. You took your personal lack of knowledge (*I only know ONE person at Google*) and turned that into an implication that \u201cMake School is lying about results\u201d instead of thinking \u201cOh neat, I only know of one person, I wonder who the others are, I should ask!\u201d\n\nPerhaps the wording of the email was vague or confusing. That\u2019s fair. But there is also a big difference between confusing or making a mistaken statement and deliberately attempting to mislead the reader.\n\nIn the future, would students find it useful for there to be a specific channel for concerns like this? We truly value the feedback, we just want to ensure that it happens in the right place and with the right intentions - for growth and improvement on all sides rather than from a place of distrust.<@Dylan Finn> maybe complain isn\u2019t the right word, it\u2019s a concern I\u2019ve personally brought up with a number of staff members myself. However, my comment was not invalidating \u201cholding a standard of truth.\u201d I just said the nature of the comments doesn\u2019t belong in <#C1D3YFP6G|general>. It\u2019s great that you all care about this stuff-maybe take it a step further and voice your concerns with the student council. Or even better, organize meetings with the pertinent people and be the change you wanna see at the school.\n\nAs someone who has *constantly* and *regularly* voiced my concerns and opinions to staff, (and was previously on the student council) I have always felt heard and 9.5/10 the problems were eventually rectified. Having an opinion is one thing, enacting change is another.^^ <@Luc Boettner> thanks for that. I cry a little bit everytime I see random stuff in the compost and recycle bins.<@Tia (TJ) King> I completely understand, and yes, I also agree that those are completely two different things, which I take my statement in regards to the curriculum back. But regardless of that there is a difference between  building a curriculum with an advice of a large corporation from building a curriculum with an advice of an engineer.if it  is compostable it\u2019s not plastic\u2026 It\u2019s made of plant material. that is the same consistency of plastic not plastic.<@Tia (TJ) King> Unfortunately that doesn't justify the misleading language used in the email and I don't believe Eliot is complaining.  We have the right to hold Make School to a standard of truth, regardless of what changes it is going through.<@Tia (TJ) King>Some newer plastics can be composted, but you have to look on the plastic to find out.also <@Dylan Finn> school has been in session for approximately two months. and I believe they visited in the spring last year. they might change it up this year but who knows? something to consult <@Megan Dias> about maybe if you\u2019re seriously curious.<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-WHRJPlL5g><!channel> guys, I just dug out 2 halal guys bags and some other plastics out of the compost bin. Plastic is not compostable! If you're too lazy to be slightly environmentally conscious by properly separating your trash, just throw it in the actual trash.<@Briant (Elliot) Oliveira> those two situations are completely unrelated for one. secondly, it\u2019s common knowledge that our curriculum is designed with the input of engineers from these various top companies. with all of the changes MS is going through with accreditation, new staff, new building, double the student size, curriculum redesign, rebranding etc\u2026its expected that things might be a little off. however, <#C1D3YFP6G|general> is not the place to be complaining about those changes.Hey Alan, with all respect I posted the image above because I did ask myself those questions. And yes, I do believe that every staff member/students should read that, because the school should be accountable for the emails they sentToday *at 4:30PM*, we'll gather in the Great Hall and you'll get a choice of talks to hear and be a part of. Here's the schedule for today:\n:zero: *MCs Uchenna, Tony, Kash, and Yves* \u2013 _Friday Afternoon Talks Kickoff_ :speaking_head_in_silhouette: :gotta_run: :goal_net: (~4:30 in Great Hall)\n:one: *MC Kash* \u2013 _Unconference Session A: Human By Design_ :aakash:  :bust_in_silhouette: :fire: :studio_microphone: (~4:40 in Stonehenge)\n:two: *Lightning Talks* :zap::speaking_head_in_silhouette: (~4:40 in Great Hall)\n\u2022 *Rohan Mishra* \u2013 _Trees &amp; Hash for a Good, Verifiable, Uneditable Time_ :deciduous_tree: :herb: :smile:\n\u2022 *Faith Chikwekwe* \u2013 _Atoll'd You My Talk Would Be Good_ :speech_balloon: :desert_island: :sun_with_face:\n\u2022 *Jasmine Humbert* \u2013 _Where'd You Get the Coconuts?_ :coconut: :palm_tree: :thinking_face: :question:\n\u2022 *Noah Woodward* \u2013 _Voice Assistant Development Crash Course_ :speaking_head_in_silhouette: :computer: :books:\n\u2022 *_BREAK_*\n\u2022 *Tia \"T.J.\" King* \u2013 _What Do You Meme: The Co-Opting of Cultural Lexicon on Social Media_ :speech_balloon: :facebook: :book:\n\u2022 *Asim Zaidi* \u2013 _How to Build a Non-Technical MVP_ :loudspeaker: :handshake: :hammer_and_wrench:\n\u2022 *Fod\u00e9 Diop* \u2013 _Demystifying Blockchain_ :heavy_dollar_sign: :magic: :brain: :thinking_face:\n\u2022 *Kuan-Ying Fang* \u2013 _An Introduction to Aerogels_ :airhorn: :male-scientist::skin-tone-5: :notebook:\n:three: *MC Tony* \u2013 _Improv Games: Keynote Karaoke_ :game_die: :studio_microphone: :laughing: (~5:10 in Stonehenge)\n\nSee you all in the Great Hall at *4:30PM*!For today, we'll be demoing a few different talk formats so that everyone has a clear picture as to how this works! *We'll be meeting from 4:30PM to 6PM in the Great Hall*, where the talks will be given.\n\nToday, there will be three core formats to our Friday Afternoon Talks: *Lightning Talks*, _Unconferences_, and `Improv Games`. *Lightning Talks* are 3-5 minute talks about any topic followed by a few audience questions and written constructive feedback. _Unconferences_ are 20-30 minute presentations/discussions also about any topic that's open format. `Improv Games` are a half-hour series of games where students pitch randomized topics for up to 1 minute per the host's discretion.<!channel>\n*HEY EVERYONE!* Happy Friday to one and all!\n\nAs I'm sure you may remember from this Monday's All Hands, today is our first-ever *Unconference and Lightning Talks*.\n\nA brief recap of what that means: every Friday moving forward, we and your friendly _Unconference Committee_ will help host a series of student-led and student-run talks, presentations, discussions, and improv games in an effort to help us all practice our public speaking and presentation skills. Over the next several terms, _every student_ will be *required to give at least one talk* on Fridays, of a format of their choice.Lol why did I get this email if I\u2019m ACTUALLY a make School student???<@Briant (Elliot) Oliveira> \"sends\" is a present tense word<@Dylan Finn> They only came once last yearWhen do I get to meet the Apple recruiting team?This message was deleted.:fire: :100: :make-school: This application is open and closes by December.

Hi <!channel> *PLEASE READ*! We have noticed recently that the general channel has been over used for messages that aren't relevant to the whole college :slack::confused:\n\nWe want to re-iterate the importance of using the general channel for general/whole college announcements :make-school:\n\n*Before sending a message ask yourself these 2 questions:*\n\n1. Is there a channel already set up that is more appropriate for this type of announcement?\n2. Does every student and staff member need to know/hear about this?\n\nFor example, if you want to send a message about a Hackathon, use the events channel. Channels can be created for specific announcements/or types of announcements, as well!Anyone good with apis?

There will be a sprinkling of fun travel stories, Make School lore, and time for Q&amp;A as well!Yes this term we are trying coaching every other week to see how it goes, we\u2019ll assess at the end of term. We made it every week for the first term since there was a lot of flux with people settling in, getting used to a new environment, need to reinforce productivity and professionalism practices, and beginning a new program.

Im always open to feedback, both good and bad, so don't hesitate to let me know what you think!For those iPhone users on iOS 12 that want to be more productive, you must check out screen time in your settings. It provides really good data on how often you use your phone, how many times you pick it up during the day, what apps you\u2019re using the most, limitations on how much time you spend using specific apps (Instagram, Facebook, or all social media apps in general), and some more features that are definitely worth checking out. If you cut just one hour of usage per day, you save 365 hours over the entire year that could be allocated towards something else.If anyone wants to use that 32 inch monitor downstairs, I brought the cables for it Yeah some people have been having that issue.

You can hear an articulate speaker and easily assume they are immune to this fear. But they likely are not. Alan and I both had a fear of public speaking and put in a lot of practice to improve. We still get the jitters regularly but are now more confident and excited to speak to groups and share our message. You\u2019ll get better by practicing, just like we did, and over time it becomes really fun!\n- Why am I sharing this? I imagine many of you feel jittery about Friday\u2019s pitches. :mount_fuji:  I think it\u2019s important that we all take a growth mindset, give everybody support (and snaps!) this Friday, and celebrate how we can all practice together in a supportive environment.

I've used them for my personal projects for about two years now. They give you SSH (but not root) access, their support is excellent, and they have Passenger set up for easy Node and Python deployment (though ngl getting Django to work with passenger and no root is a pain but it is doable). You can have multiple people on one account with their own logins with unlimited sites, users, databases, and domains. I share my account with a friend and we split the cost ($8/month).\n\nHere's my referral link, I think it gives us both $50 credit when you sign up: <https://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?1506015/promo/dreamsavings50/>So what's happening for all the people failing their classes or not passing?here's a nice template using Markdown you can use(copy and paste) to plan out your product following Agile method. <https://github.com/MediBoss/SECP/blob/master/README.md>This is Hunter, he is an alumni from Make School who works at Google.

At least we know now moving forwards.Would also love a #lostandfound channel!Can we have an #important or #urgent channel?

Why we do intensives*: most college calendars are so packed that students barely have time to work on projects. Not at Make School :make-school:! We set aside time for you to build your portfolio and ship projects you love\n*2. You\u2019ll build your product solo (for Jrs.)*: so you have full stack experience instead of just doing the role that is most comfortable. Next term SPD will be a partner project!\n*3. Product Pitches*: We\u2019ll end Friday with Product Pitches, more info in the rubrics that will be covered on Monday. We\u2019ll have a class sessions on how to deliver a pitch \u2026 :mega:\n*4. Rubrics*: outlining how to pass the product and pitch are in the doc linked below\n*5. Make the most out of this opportunity*:  As demonstrated in the paper plane activity (srs had at orientation), and our blog post feedback sessions, your work quality skyrockets when you get feedback from peers. For these reasons, each day of the intensive will feature two \u201cLevel-Up\u201d meetings with your huddle group to do code reviews :iphone:, wireframe testing :art: , practice pitches :speaking_head_in_silhouette:, etc. Show up ready with questions and eager to give feedback to peers - it\u2019s good practice for when you are senior engineer later in your career.\n*6. What you need to do now for the Intensive \u2026*: nothing - other than think of what product you\u2019d like to build! Finish out the term strong, we\u2019ll review all this again on Monday.\n<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lRHbwCdrmxpVEEu_UwbUcRLtC-hvqc3IeZ3OTlAzNgo/edit#>it's not too late to sign up as a mentor for the hackathon being hosted on campus this weekend! :make-school: :muscle: :nerd_face:Yee-hawI know some students are unhappy with the 12:00 huddles, because it doesn't give much time between the 9:30 huddle and that one.

I am not going to make any crazy campaign promises that I can\u2019t keep. What I will promise is to continuously strive to be someone that everyone feels comfortable coming to talk to about personal and academic advice, stressors, or concerns. It is my goal as junior rep to be able to stand up and be a voice for our community, and affectively communicate the needs and wants of our student body to instructors and staff. And I will continue to follow up with these needs and wants until they are followed through to the staff\u2019s best ability. Thanks for your time and consideration, and good luck to everyone!

I hope that doesn't deter you from voting for me. As Junior Student Rep I'll continue to do what I do best which is listen to any and all suggestions you may have to improve the student experience. I also have a few idea's of my own including weekend office hours, \"Halloweek\" and few ideas to make our stay at Vantaggio more comfortable.

Last year, I think it was easier to vote for people because everyone already kind of knew everyone else. This year, I only know a handful of juniors after the first few weeks, which is limiting who I might vote for. In the future, I think it would be good if the nominees introduced themselves and gave a little spiel for why people should vote for them. Maybe during one of the first unconferences?

Those of us on the ISA have also been approached about unpaid rent by Vantaggio.<@Raymond Wu> thanks for sending this! I'll message you individually! <@Megan Dias> Several students, myself included, have been approached by Vantaggio asking about payments for rent. I thought that this was covered by the recent Make School invoice from <http://bill.com|bill.com> / <http://kongbasile.com|kongbasile.com> . Attached is the line item. Also of HIGH importance is that this amount is higher than what I agreed upon (should have been $950). I've also spoken with another student where their 6th floor discount was not appliedSame hereSAME Yeah, I think we need to clarify what exactly is going on with this with the school.Vantaggio in common areaSo I just talked to the guy again, and I think I understand it now. The Vantaggio is trying to switch from a 16th to the 15th pay period to a pay period that runs from the 1st of the month to the end of the month. So the period between Sept. 16th and Oct 1st will be prorated (half of what we're paying per month) and then we will pay again on the 1st of October for the month of October. The front desk guy (I forgot his name) says he's emailed Make School about the issue.SamesameHello all, hope everyone is having a good weekend. Could anyone help me with the homepage project for frontend?I have also encountered the same thing.I have encountered the same thing.Has anyone on the stipend ISA been approached by the Vantaggio to pay extra rent? I was having a hard time getting the particulars, but it sounds like if you\u2019re receiving living assistance and moved in on the weekend of the 17th there\u2019s a two week period for rent that has not been paid / covered by Vemo.I believe the syntax would be something like\u2026\n`ngrok http 10.0.0.188:3000` this will as a result point ngrok to another host behind a firewall.You could just create a tunnel using ngrok, that would fix the restriction you two are facing with geographic proximity.<@Vincenzo Marcella> I'll have to take you up on it soon thanksJust let me know whenever you have free time, and we can definitely work something out. <@Carlos Alba><@Vincenzo Marcella> Touch\u00e9, unfortunately I can't access them till the beginning of this week since I am offsite but I would love to browse the collection soon!It already can be hosted 24/7 as is and I do have a VPS, but due to some other nontechnical conditions I\u2019ve decided that exposing it publicly would not be the best idea.<@Vincenzo Marcella> You should get an apache file server or something running on aws or heroku that way it can be hosted 24/7For those of you staying at Vantaggio and are currently on the Vantaggio wifi, If you head over to <http://10.0.0.188:3000>, you\u2019ll have access to a plethora of pdfs that I am currently hosting from now until around 9-10 PM. :slightly_smiling_face: Let me know what you think of my collection and if you have any books you\u2019d like to add, please PM me.Anyone online?

A student left a MS backpack with a :computer: inside at the front corner of the Great Hall, please dm Chloe to get it back. Please note that you are not to leave your personal effects in the Make School building. To seniors especially, I know we were lax about this last year but with the new building we will be much more strict about keeping this space tidy so that all can enjoy! :make-school: :slightly_smiling_face::+1:<https://www.linkedin.com/in/dylan-finn-a36b9614b/>Last year it opened and closed around 8 idk if it\u2019s different this year Hi Anne! How early/late is the actual Make School building open? i.e. can we be at the school earlier or later than classes to work on projects and meet with others?Let's have a great year guys! Woot WootFor those of you asking about SPD - EVERYONE needs to enroll in SPD.  Juniors in SPD 1.1 and Seniors in SPD 2.1  Juniors will be assigned a section on Monday morning.Hello wonderful students of the Make School.  Many of you are wondering when you will get your class schedule.  The illustrious Dani is slaving away and will have class lists by 9:30 AM Monday if not sooner.  Monday starts at 9:30 AM for ALL STUDENTS (Juniors and Seniors).  You should plan on being at Make School from 9:30 to 5:30 every day - with some of that in class and some in labs.<https://www.google.com/search?q=weather+in+los+altos&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS810US810&amp;oq=Weather+in+loS+a&amp;aqs=chrome.0.0l2j69i57j0l3.5623j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8>When will we find out what classes we're in?

But another workaround would be to look up their portfolio pages on the dashboard if they used their profile pics.Are all students going to be invited to the google calendar events for each class?Theoretically if everyone is in here and set their profile pictures to a picture of themselves the Slack directory could workIs there anything like a Product College student directory with everyone\u2019s faces and names? Basically the same thing that was there for the summer academy\u2019s. It would help learning people\u2019s name, I think.Yeah I forgot I had already done that lol.

They are called \"Downtown Streets Team\" and I will be volunteering when I can on the weekends and if anyone else would be interesting in volunteering, feel free to private message me. \n\nAside from just the satisfaction of helping the area stay clean and preventing someone from possibly being poked by a used needles, they do incentivize volunteers with a gift card. \nI'm not apart of the organization but I just wanted to let others know if that was something they would be interested in doing. <@Anwar Azeez> has joined the channelI was wondering why not just cut down the middle, but nvm d:Hey <!channel> - very excited to have all of you in the building and looking forward to both introducing myself more formally on Thursday at Staff Introductions and getting to know each of you personally.

We will also provide socks and slippers at the entrance if you would like to wear those in addition to your own socks. If you want to bring a pair of indoor shoes (only used inside), you are welcome to keep those shoes at Make School.

If you\u2019ve had problems with teams in the past this is for *YOU* - Here\u2019s a quick blerb:\n\nBeing cognitively smart isn\u2019t enough. In order to succeed at work, we all need a combination of technical skills, cognitive abilities (IQ), and emotional intelligence (EQ).

In this workshop, you\u2019ll learn key EQ related leadership skills.  \n\nResearch shows that\u2026\n\n1. 90% of our career success comes from EQ, when IQ is roughly equal  \n2. 71% of hiring managers value EQ in an employee over IQ  \n3. 65% of startups fail due to co-founder conflict\n\nIf you have class at this time - normal rules apply - you have to ask to leave.

Hopefully, everyone is having an amazing winter break. :champagne::snowman_without_snow::sunglasses:Amazing how far AI has come.Reminder: Reminder: Basement closed on Wednesdays 1-2p during lunch for Staff Meeting.Happy holidays, all! I\u2019ve been asked this enough that it warrants posting in the general channel.  If you\u2019re planning on taking the DS1 course, we highly recommend you complete the following courses as prework.  DS1 is NOT a math class--our main focus will be using best practices to pull insights from data, and communicate them effectively.  However, many of these best practices assume a basic level of competency in statistics.  *If you plan on taking our DS course offerings, please treat the following links as prework:*\n\n1. Introduction to Descriptive Statistics  <https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-descriptive-statistics--ud827>\n\n2.  Introduction to Inferential Statistics <https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-inferential-statistics--ud201>\n\n3. Math Skills for Data Science <https://www.coursera.org/learn/datasciencemathskills>\n\nIf you also plan on taking DS2 and DS3, these courses are *extremely important*.  Gaining these foundational skills aren\u2019t hard, but if you don\u2019t have them, anything related to machine learning is going to seem like an alien language!\n\nLastly, if you run into any concepts that are a roadblock--you don\u2019t understand them, have lingering questions, etc, please write them down! I\u2019m happy to answer questions over slack, or during the first week of class.  \n\nEnjoy the rest of your holiday break--see you all soon!Merry Christmas All!! Have a safe holiday as well as a happy New Year!Whatevs\u2026my 2015 has the magsafe.

Our customers consist of small businesses and entrepreneurs, so our customers are the ones who will feel the impact most if Net Neutrality rules are reversed.\n\nBy rolling back the rules, the FCC is threatening the ability for anyone to start a business and have their voices heard. Also, broadband providers like Comcast and AT&amp;T will be let off from adhering to basic consumer protection laws. We strongly believe that this action by the FCC is fundamentally wrong.\n\nWhat can I do?\n\nAct today! The vote is coming up any day now, so time is of the essence. If you value an open Internet and support small businesses and entrepreneurs, please call and write to your local lawmakers today to let them know that open Internet rules need to stay.Technical breakdown of the High Sierra root password bug:\n<https://objective-see.com/blog/blog_0x24.html>Hey all!

Please refresh the page. Sorry for the inconvenience!Hi <!channel> \nBACKGROUND\nAs you may know, an important aspect of the PC student experience is mentorship. Mentors may offer you helpful guidance such as personalized technical feedback and career guidance. The Mentoring Program ensures you are working to forming meaningful and regular connections with professionals in industry. In some cases, mentors may serve as a reference or even help you obtain an internship or full-time job, no promises or guarantees, but they can be an important key to achieving your Make School and job hunt goals. Also, mentoring is all-volunteer. Our partners and allies have offered to take time out of their busy schedules to to find ways to support Make School and help YOU.\n\nNearly all the seniors still have active mentor relationships with one or more mentors they engaged with last year. Awesome!\n\nLet\u2019s start off slowly - Instead of forming a long term mentorship relationship, just set up ONE coffee meeting with a mentor.\n\nTHE ASK\nWe are asking that you meet (via phone, video or in-person) with at least one volunteer mentor at least once before December 31 and again at least once by May 15.\n\n\nNEXT STEPS\n11/6  -- Review the list of volunteer mentors here:\n<https://docs.google.com/a/makegameswith.us/spreadsheets/d/1PUffTZwaYVe3EWcCqF_2czeDV0KsEEjJzt-SIyziZVY/edit?usp=sharing>\n11/10 -- Add your name to up to three mentors you\u2019d like to connect with. First come, first serve. When the 3 slots fill up, move on and select someone else. \n11/10-13 -- Draft an email to your prospective mentor(s) to schedule a time to meet prior to the Core class. Dan will help you finalize it.\nSeniors: Please slack me directly the name and email of your current mentor(s), if you have one.\n\nQUESTIONS?\nPlease slack <@U2C90LDS9> and myself directly.\n\nThanks!\nSusanMake School is open :sunrise:<https://builttoadapt.io/why-a-personal-brand-is-necessary-for-todays-developer-f0f18bfaa033>This means more daylight in the morning, when we get up.Hi. Just wanted to give you a friendly reminder to set your clocks BACK on SATURDAY night for an extra hour!<@Adam Braus> I\u2019m going to respectfully suggest that this falls into the category of anecdotes that people find compelling because they want them to be true.  The concept an \u201calpha\u201d extends into primatology and behavioral zoology to describe the apex of dominance hierarchies (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_hierarchy>).  \n\nThis can correspond to many different forms of power within in a group.  Reproductive access is most commonly seen among other of our closest ancestors such as Gorillas and Chimps as defining what an alpha is along with other social animals that are sexually dimorphic (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dimorphism>).  \n\nAlpha males in these types of groups are the males that are able to hold control of a harem of females for long enough to ensure reproductive fecundity against the competing outside bachelor group that is vying for reproductive access as well (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harem_(zoology)>).\n\nNow there are other ways to define what \u201calpha\u201d means but if humanity shares any of these aspects with our most common cousins the solution to addressing these problems is in understanding our humanity, not in dismissing it.  \n\nJust like in many instances in natural and sexual selection, traits that can be selected for in one context can be harmful in another.  Accordingly idea of being an alpha male is mostly a bad one in the modern world even if certain subcultures of high testosterone men see it as a positive.  Often alphas are over selected for violence and aggression and this wreaks havoc to the internal success of the group.  \n\nIn evolutionary psychology, studies show that high testosterone and low cortisol tends to produce those we commonly see a leaders in both men and women. But those who tend to apply their aggression internally (such as those who are most likely to commit sexual assault) are more likely to be high testosterone and high cortisol.  This approximately means, high aggression and also highly stressed/insecure ( here is one such study\u2026 <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3693622/>).  \n\nMy mom was a primatologist that studied under Louis Leakey and I can assure you that researches do use the term \u201calpha\u201d in the context of behavioral research.\n\nTLDR; The notion of alpha is useful in evolutionary psychology and zoology to describe dominance hierarchies and the solution to solving these sorts of social problems in humanity and culture is not by pretending our biology doesn\u2019t play a role, but to actually understand it.<http://www.businessinsider.com/no-such-thing-alpha-male-2016-10><@Jordan King> has joined the channelThanks y\u2019all for an awesome session with Brandon on Communication &amp; Consent!

How can I get started?_\u201d\n:bulb: Don\u2019t try to write out every word and make it perfect. Just jot down a few bullet points and arrange them in order. Practice talking for ~1 minute about each point. Then practice the whole talk in the mirror. Then practice with a friend, and ask for feedback. Then practice with 3-5 friends and ask for feedback.

Hey guys, just an update for anyone wondering. My house is located in the bennet valley neighborhood in santa rosa and we\u2019ve had some fires come pretty close but so far none have reached the neighborhood. Most of the pictures i\u2019ve uploaded have been taken from my street/area and it\u2019s been pretty dang creepy here. I\u2019m ok and my family is ok but a lot of my friends have lost houses and it looks like about half the city is burned to the ground. We had an evacuation scare last night when a lot of bennet valley was told to evacuate but the winds switched up and started blowing the flames away from us. I actually started to drive back to SF a couple hours ago when things seemed to have calmed down but about half way there the fire next to me came back to life and was shooting flames 100 feet into the air so i turned around and came back. Looks like there have been 13 deaths so far, and i think I heard that over 100,000 acres have burned (to give you perspective all of Oakland is about 50,000 acres) so that isn\u2019t a very comforting thought. I don\u2019t really know of the best way for you guys to help, but there are a lot of shelters in need of food and volunteers so if any of you guys know anyone that wants to volunteer the Double Tree hotel in Rohnert Park is assigning volunteers to the places that need it. \n\nhere\u2019s the link to the album of my pictures: <https://imgur.com/gallery/3zk4Q>Thanks you all!!!!

I'll be here through lunch. Not sure what time I'll leave. Feel free to come by and work.Yeah I think if we can review our speeches we will get a lot better at them. I also think we should start a public speaking club where we review our speeches and learn techniques and stuff. It would be cool if the Make School Facebook live streams the lightning talks then we put it on a youtube channel (people can opt out of it).Yet, still hurt:relieved:what doesn\u2019t kill you makes you strongersorry for the no show my body hates me :confused:I\u2019m down!  Though that can definitely up the psychological factor for a lot people who are new to public speaking and trying to get ease their way in.  I know MS used to have a streaming setup somewhere or at the very least used to record lectures and talks in the past.  The few speeches of myself that I have recorded were the absolute best ways for me to truly see how I performed and what could be improved.  As cringey as it can be to watch yourself sometimes, it is invaluable nevertheless.It would be cool if we just streamed all lightning talks and put it on YouTube for people to watch later. Like MakeTalksWe tried setting up a TEDx event last year. If students are interested in trying again, you should talk to <@Michael Loubier> about what to do right.

Thanks for this Jade!<@Alan Davis [CS]> pinned a message to this channel.Hi Everyone-\n\nImportant news! Make School has partnered with a mental health center, *Two Chairs*, to provide professional therapy services. More information below. Once the wiki is up and running again, all this will be added.\n\nTwo Chairs (<https://www.2chairs.co/>) is Make School\u2019s mental health center located in Downtown San Francisco at 311 California St. just a five minute walk from the Montgomery Street and Embarcadero BART stations.\n\nTwo Chairs offers similar benefits to a physical college counseling center like next-day appointments, a diverse team of clinicians, expert-driven triage and multi-specialty expertise that covers most common conditions.\n\nAs Make School students, you\u2019ll have access to one consult appointment and up to six ongoing therapy sessions annually, for $10 copay per session.\n\nYou can schedule a consult appointment online via the link below. Be sure to use the coupon code MAKESCHOOL when signing up so that your $10 copay is applied: <https://www.2chairs.co/book-a-consult>.\n\nMake School will also host Two Chairs for onsite educational presentations throughout the school year. Their first presentation, \u201cMental Health 101\u201d will be held next Friday, October 13th from 4-5p. You\u2019ll have a chance to submit questions about mental health anonymously in advance, and during the presentation as well.Hey everyone, I forgot to post this yesterday, <#C7CQXJH0X|bike-club> is set up for those that were interested in getting together to bike on the weekends!

Anyone can walk in and use it as a playground or work space! And the special guest was none other than Chelsea Manning, well-known hacker and political personality known for her work and ethical history with the US government culminating in her prison sentence and recent early release (I believe she was pardoned by Obama), as well as her fame in the hacking and transgender/modern civil rights community. Was a very powerful discussion learning about her past and plans moving forward! <!channel> - Hi there everyone - you all have lots of questions and issues and we want to answer them and help you as quickly as possible, however, we are getting a bit overloaded.

I would like to discuss possible projects and get an idea of how many people are interested. This club will be mainly focused towards using code to control physical devices.

I know I talked to some of us about trying to get some membership deals for the martial arts academy closeby to the Make School. So far, one of the best ways we could possibly arrange that is if there\u2019s multiple students interested so we could get a package deal or something similar. If you\u2019re interested in attending the _Fight and Fitness_ gym right next to the Make School for muay thai, MMA, boxing, and/or Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ), let me know by messaging/getting in touch with me or by reacting below with the :facepunch: emoji! Thanks all! :heart:I was thinking rapping, but I am down for dancing too.Good afternoon fellow nerds, developers, and Make School students!\n\nFor those of you who I haven't met yet, let me first introduce myself: My name is Michael. I'm a Make School senior returning this year to take a few classes while working my full-time job as a VR Developer at a startup focused on enriching the lives of elderly patients, specifically those with neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's and dementia. I also taught this summer at Make School Summer Academy as one of the Games instructors here in SF, where we hosted weekly game nights to engage and support the students\u2019 work-life balance. I\u2019m also a gamer, a writer, a \u201cfigure-it-outer\u201d, and a social games enthusiast, which is what this message is about!\n\nI invite everyone who is interested in tabletop games (i.e. card games, board games, tabletop RPGs...etc.) to join the <#C2QJ4CN21|tabletop_games> channel to discuss what we can do to foster community at Make School through these socially-engaged games! I worked with some fellow students last year to help playtest and develop a tabletop RPG called Open Legend which was just recently featured at GenCon in Indianapolis, and I\u2019d love to work with all of you on any tabletop side-projects that catch your eyes! I also wrote a small campaign for my classmates and hosted a bi-weekly D&amp;D/Open Legend game, which I\u2019m happy to do again if there is a group interested in getting started! \u2028\u2028\n\nFeel free to reach out to me if you have any questions about why I love tabletop (and digital) socially-engaged games, or anything else that I might be able to help with!Freestyle? Like freestyle dancing, rapping, or what?I have added everyone to the running club slack who signed up at the retreat yesterday. If you want to join and were not added to the slack, message me and I'll add you. \n\nAlso a few of us were thinking of doing a freestyle club after Lightning talks on Fridays.

You can check it out at: <https://www.howtographql.com> :mortar_board:\n\nWe collaborated with many prominent members of the GraphQL community to create tutorials for all major programming languages and frameworks - all content is free and open-source.\n\nWe\u2019re currently on Product Hunt and will be on Hackernews later today. I would appreciate your support there a ton :slightly_smiling_face: Let me know if you have any questions around this whole project!\n\nCheers and best wishes from Berlin! :blue_heart::wave::skin-tone-2: hi!

How do you focus on finding an opportunity that will allow maximum career growth and impact for the long-run amidst all the hype and craziness of Silicon Valley?\n\nThis workshop will teach you to look beyond the hype in choosing your next startup opportunity. By focusing on yourself (your values, motivators, energies, and personal mission) and drowning out the noise, you\u2019ll be better equipped to make more deliberate decisions that allows you to achieve your goals. Rocketships are incredibly rare (they\u2019re called \u201cunicorns\u201d for a reason) but at the minimum, you\u2019ll still gain critical skills, experience, and exposure to growing a company to make you even more valuable and marketable for your next opportunity, whenever that might be.<!here|@here> meatballs with mushroom sauce in student lounge - PS there is pork in it, so if you don't eat pork please don't take any.

For those of you I spoke with last night, please remember to slack me so I can make the connections I mentioned I would make.\n\nOnward and upward!Congrats everyone! Fantastic job!

I want to take a moment to acknowledge this point in the program, and help y\u2019all work through it. (tl;dr: There\u2019s light at the end of the tunnel)\n\n1) Yes, this is a stressful time\n2) You are not alone in feeling stressed\n3) The stress season won\u2019t last forever- There *IS* an end point\n4) There are effective ways of managing stress (see below)\n5) Make School is here to help you!\n\nFirst thing\u2019s first: Take care of your body! Sleep, exercise, healthy food, and water are your BEST defenses against stress and getting sick.\n\n:sweat_drops: Drink lots of water! Seems suspiciously simple, but water is an essential human element and we need it to function, stay alert, and flush out toxins\n:zzz: Get plenty of rest. Less sleep results in a decrease in immunity, making you more susceptible to getting sick. Sufficient sleep, especially keeping to a bed/walking routine, helps stabilize your immune system.\n:tangerine: Eat healthy foods. Increase your Vitamin C intake- especially through whole foods (citrus, bell peppers, strawberries, etc)\n:walking: Go for a 10 minute walk. If you\u2019re feeling stressed, your body processes and releases that best when you are physically in motion (rather than taking a Facebook mini-break or playing computer game). Plug in your favorite tunes and take a loop around the block for a boost.\n:tired_face: Talk to someone you trust. Let them know how you\u2019re feeling in the moment. \n:blue_heart: Jade has office hours to help you with more customized strategies for your particular needs. <https://calendly.com/jade-4/office-hours> If you can\u2019t find a time here, slack me a message and we\u2019ll find a time to meet. \n\nStay positive, stay strong, y\u2019all. We\u2019re in this together\n:muscle:MS is openMS will be open by 8:30Awesome<@Brian Hans> canoeing \ud83d\udef6 is cheapest I think for rentals. The inner tubes aren't as cheap as splitting a raft 6-7 ways. Plus it's more fun if you down in teams. \n\nAlso my buddy is connected to a company that rents foldable kayaks. They basically fit in the trunk of a car easy like a folded cardboard box but expand out pretty easily to a full sized kayak. I'll try to get more info. The Russian river is pretty close to that although it is a bit more of a blend of picturesque mountain beauty with lazy beer float, meets mild rapids. \n\nThe next best option would be the Stanislaus river near Oakdale, CA. That's about 2.5 hours away. But it's definitely probably what you are used to in the south. Lazy beer float. Russian river is also supposedly a good place to tube at and there are places nearby where you can buy a cheap inner tube Head to head custom game console kits ready for students to wire up and program in the C/C++ and devices class.  Will be making head to head snake game for demo day.Ready for students to wire and programIs there like a lazy river we can ride innertubes on? My vote would be for russian river. There's a dope rope swing spot over the river there that could be fun. Not sure if there are rental places up there though.Where would kayaking be? Russian river?I've been to other K1s p good<https://www.k1speed.com/san-francisco-location.html>I guess it depends on the Go Kart place we\u2019re going.

No one has asked you to *_hide_* that you\u2019re a student. You can\u2019t and you simply shouldn\u2019t. It\u2019s about how you present yourself in your role/title and in the summary line of your resume. Braus put it very clearly:\n&gt;Nope just put it in your education section\n&gt;But don\u2019t say in your bio \u201cI\u2019m a student\u201d - just say \u201cI\u2019m a software engineer\u201d\nI suggest you try reading this ^ again *_very literally_* and avoid reading into it much further.\n\nIt\u2019s not about misrepresenting yourself or deceiving anyone, it\u2019s about the optics of how you present yourself.<@Corey Harrilal> <@Michael Loubier> Thanks!Yup. I agree ^. Mentioning Make School without the student status is more than enough.I have listed Make School under my \"Education\" section, without listing graduation date. Technically we will be \"graduates\" of the first year of the program bfore beginning any of these things. Merely saying that you have attended Make School w/o regards to your current status should be enough.<@Alex Pena> I think the point is that we shouldn't advertise that we are students blatantly on the resume. If, for some reason, the topic of Make School comes up, then of course you can mention what Make School is and your status. But for now, it's not essential to add that risk on our resume.<@Adam Braus> How would you recommend we maintain the Make School brand on our LinkedIn and resume\u2019s without including that we are students? We have yet to graduate Make School, so I find it difficult to find any way to phrase what Make School is to us. If we didn\u2019t graduate but are unable to say we are students, what then can we say?+1 to that. I can teach just about anyone to do just about anything. What I can't teach you is to be willing to learn, able to be taught, tolerable over time, and have the right attitude.<@David Ciaffoni> If you ask me, it\u2019s just about who can \u201csell\u201d himself better to a prospective employer. Don\u2019t want to put it in numbers, but I think actual skill has a very low impact when it comes to getting through the door.Agreed<@David Ciaffoni> Welcome to the world of job searching. Ain't nothing straight-forward about it, is the truth.Just remember the mantra \"reduce perceived risk, increase perceived value\"Indeed it is convoluted, but it is also the way it goes. Lowkey this whole process feels like an unnecessarily convoluted game. Not a jab at MS, but job searching in general.Yes use your personal email (not make school email) <@Nicholas Swift> AgreedBc students sound like you are immature and lack trainingYou want to increase perceived value and reduce perceived risk. Including make school increases value bc it is elite specialized training. calling yourself a student increases perceived  risksBut don't say in your bio \"I'm a student\" - just say \"I'm a software engineer\"Nope just put it in your education sectionDoes that mean remove Make School from our resumes?I would definitely use your personal email. Keep contact info as universal as possible.  Your resume my stay on file for a number of years and your school email might disappear in the meantime.Should we still use our makeschool student emails?You are ALL of a much higher ability that most internsIt is freaking people out that I recommend you all to.

Thanks for sharingA piece to this might be people not checking their email very regularly when they are busy. I calendar reoccurring 5 minute email checks twice a day to make sure I keep up with it.Hey All- Regarding the earlier message on professionalism, here is one of the actual emails I received. This is coming directly from someone in the industry on how we do/don\u2019t make a good impression. Like I mentioned earlier, it\u2019s never too late to follow up with a thank-you! :heart: Start today to build into your networking/interview prep &amp; protocol to always send a follow-up after!\n\n\u201cOne thing that I hope you can work with the students on is professionalism. At this point I have met with 4 students and not one has followed up with me in a timely manner with a thank you and any next steps. To me professionalism is following up within a few days with a thank you and and their resume if they would like me to pass it along. If they ask me to email intro them to a recruiter then it is professional for them to reply to that email where i intro them within 24hrs where they they introduce themselves to the recruiter and give the recruiter their information with me CCed so that I know they followed up. What I have had happen is not hearing one thing from them after I provide lunch, advice, and we decide next steps either forever or for 2 weeks. When I have intro\u2019d them to a recruiter they either don\u2019t reply to the recruiter for awhile or reply to them without me CCed, so then I don\u2019t know if the recruiter was ever handled or felt snubbed. This makes me leery on introing people to others in the company even though I want to help. These students may simply not know etiquette in which case it would be helpful for you or some team member to educate them so that Makeschool can still receive powerful support from industry.\u201dHey all.

This is universal and not specific to one person.\n\n*Please make this a high priority starting today.*\n\nPlease take a few minutes and send brief thank you emails to all the speakers, mentors, informational interviews, tours, job interviews you have had since January, if you haven\u2019t already.\n\nRemember, it is never too late to say Thank You. If you need email addresses, please ping me or Susan.\n\nEveryone has their \u201cthing\u201d. Good manners is Susan\u2019s b/c her network is her professional currency.\n\nIt\u2019s your professional reputation (and ours and sometimes mine or other students/staff) that gets dinged when we don\u2019t all show outsiders this common curtesy.\n\nPlease and thank you will build, maintain your network and be the difference one day in having doors open for you, favors extended and jobs offered. It\u2019s free, fast and easy. If you need help or templates let me know.

I was wondering how much people know about initializers in Swift.With respect to the above conversation about growth, I have to say that I also agree that this is really important.  Even if you don\u2019t care to go the entrepreneurial path yourself, it is incredibly important to know what it\u2019s like to sit in the shoes of your boss and ultimately the company you work for. The point is that learning to lead isn\u2019t just about being good at leading, it also helps you be a better employee. You gain insight into the psyche of the organizations you will work for and this ultimately makes you a better part of a team..  This works the other way too.  Good managers/leaders are aware of what it\u2019s like to perform in the roles they manage.They're on the podium. I saw them about an hour before I left make school But hopefully someone does. If not, I'll check Tuesday.I left without knowing they were gone, so I don't know.Are they not there still?Oh. Do you know where they were put?Oooh- <@Corey Harrilal>  I saw a pair on the podium after demo pitches. Hey all. I left my glasses at make school. Has anyone seen them? One side is taped.<@Alan Davis [CS]> pinned a message to this channel.I totally agree with Braus, and I can say that I\u2019ve met tons of \u201ccode monkeys\u201d in college, but very few people who understand product growth. In addition to our portfolio, I think this is what will distinguish ourselves from college grads.Also as employees at startups, you will need to assess if a startup is growing well (so that your stock options appreciate!). So understanding growth will let you have a better sense of which company is going up and which is a bit lost.Oh and you can use the growth techinques things that aren\u2019t startups like open source projectsI\u2019ve had a few questions about the importance of understanding product growth for developers looking mainly for a job. Here\u2019s why we include Growth &amp; Traction in the Product College curriculum:\n\nMore than one student from last year has told me independently that a major advantage they had over other engineers was they understood how the whole company worked from 10,000 feet. Understanding the Why behind features and designs makes you better than the engineer that blindly does what she is instructed to do. We will be doing lots of technical growth and learning the tech of growth, and students will need to build an MVP, but that will most likely be a landing page to collect emails and analytics. Also even if today you don\u2019t want to do a startup, in a year or two in the work force, you might likely want to build your own thing and what you learn in this class will be critical when that time comes.Presentation Practice Protips:\n1. Record yourself! Great way to get auto-feedback\n2. Practice holding a microphone. It's a learned skill, and can be a great way to project confidence\n3. Practice, practice, practice\n4.

There is always Q4 and year 2)If a course says you have to apply directly to the instructor, the bar is very high for these courses. Do not assume you will be admitted.If you are thinking you want to be an iOS developer maybe take both iOS classes.If you are thinking two years at Make School and being a summer academy instructor this summer, keep taking iOS but take other stuff too and skip out on the data structures (you can do that stuff next year)You\u2019re just hired for one. So if iOS is not so much your thing and you think you\u2019ll have a better chance at an internship with full stack web, don\u2019t take iOS. (There are a lot more front end and full stack jobs than iOS jobs).Just a note for everyone. This quarter you should be dropping things that you are not going to concentrate on. No one is hired to be an iOS, Front End, Full Stack, Devices developer<@Alex Reilly> I think anyone can take it.My understanding is that students who have taken and successfully completed advanced IOS or FRP could take this.  Students that have only taken accelerated IOS but have continued developing IOS projects could take a skills assessment  prerequisite test.  The FRP class was a specialty course that provided students exposure to a cutting edge framework, but is not a prerequisite for this class.  As we are still retaining an instructor for this class, and recommending the topics to be covered, my perspective is that this class should expand and deepen students experience and breadth of knowledge of IOS subsystems while helping them create more beautiful and interactive user interfaces.<@Adam Braus> Where does \" Advanced iOS: Animations, UIKit &amp; Unit Testing\" fit in the iOS track?Sent by email as wellM/W/F\t10am\t\u2013 iOS Instructor \u2013 Advanced iOS: Animations, UIKit &amp; Unit Testing\nPrerequisite: Advanced iOS mastery\nM/W/F\t10am\t\u2013 Mitchell \u2013 Front-end Web 3: JavaScript &amp; ReactJS\nPrerequisite: JavaScript and front-end mastery \u2013 apply directly to Mitchell\n\nM/W/F\t1pm\t\u2013 Braus \u2013 Full-stack Web: ExpressJS, MongoDB, NodeJS, &amp; JQuery\nPrerequisite: Basic JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and familiarity with Bootstrap (JavaScript Codecademy, Dash tutorial, Bootstrap, What is NodeJS, JS Event Loop, How Node Works, )\nM/W/F\t1pm\t\u2013 Alan \u2013 Advanced Data Structures &amp; Algorithms with Python\nPrerequisite: Tweet Generator mastery \u2013 apply directly to Alan\n\nTu/Th\t10am\t\u2013 Shannon \u2013 Advanced Devices &amp; Internet of Things\nPrerequisite: Intro to Devices mastery\nTu/Th  10am \u2013 iOS instructor \u2013 iOS Seminar\nPrerequisites: iOS Expertise - Apply to Braus\n\nTu/Th\t1pm\t\u2013 Shannon \u2013 Intro to Devices &amp; Internet of Things\nPrerequisite: Basic Python experience - Python Koans\nTu/Th\t1pm\t\u2013 Alan \u2013 Tweet Generator: Data Structures &amp; Probability with Python\nPrerequisite: Basic Python experience (Koans) and OOP proficiency in any language (OOP code academy)Awesome! <!channel> the instructors have a course list prepared with prerecs.

I could use a few tips to get startedMake school is open!The risk with extension cords and multiple outlet strips being connected to each other is that if the extension cords or strips connected to the wall outlet do not contain an overload circuit breaker and has too much load placed on it, it can be overloaded, the wires can heat up and then cause a fire.  Extension cords and power strips are not required to be capable of handling the maximum amount of amps a wall outlet can provide.  This is why there are \"appliance\" extension cords that have thick wires capable of handling the maximum amps a wall outlet can provide.  The way we use chained power strips is VERY unlikely to cause an overload with laptops.  But with gaming computers used for VR, for example, this is a risk.  Plugging one of our portable air conditioners into an extension cord or strip is a very bad idea.:zap: dope :zap:I do however recommend chaining functions :stuck_out_tongue:RIP Parrot =((kidding about the lightning talk please don\u2019t chain extension cords)Now that we passed I\u2019m really pumped to give my fire dancing lightning talk, I\u2019ll teach folks how to light the torch by chaining extension cords until they spark. Works like a charm.Yay! To clarify we scheduled this fire inspection for today, they weren\u2019t just randomly scrutinizing us.

Can ppl check out my site and give me feedback? <http://juliageist.com|juliageist.com><!channel> Hi Everyone! \n\nTLDR:  There is an opportunity to collectively give Make School constructive feedback.  If you would like to share - 1) fill out a SBAR using this template (<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jFM6XuyA_AlsQ-tBlqBJNTNvL5n14GMBar9oRcjoOvI/edit#heading=h.e5ep3hnmzv3c>) \n2) Fill out this Doodle: <http://doodle.com/poll/rdr5y4cqnhpyhsmp>\n3) Come to the meeting on Monday\n\nI hope you all are enjoying your weekend and getting some good rest and work done :slightly_smiling_face:  As some of you are aware yesterday a group of students started a conversation about ways we can improve Make School: specifically generate the best outcomes for everyone, resolve current frustrations, and in general find ways to improve inefficiencies!  Make School is great and we all want to see it improve!  One super effective way of providing actionable recommendations is through using a type of document called an SBAR. That stands for Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation.  If you have ideas for ways Make School can improve and things that it is currently doing well we would love for you to share!  \n\n****ACTIONABLES***** \nOk everyone, here is the plan that <@U1VD417CP> thoughtfully suggested using many peoples ideas:\n1) fill out SBAR individually (Here is the template: <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jFM6XuyA_AlsQ-tBlqBJNTNvL5n14GMBar9oRcjoOvI/edit#heading=h.e5ep3hnmzv3c>)\n2) bring to the group meeting \n3) brainstorm solutions as a group \nthen 4) present to founders, instructors, staff, and anyone else interested \n\nNow you are probably wondering when the group meeting is and well we are doing it monday!  But at what time remains to be determined and it will be determined through this Doodle: <http://doodle.com/poll/rdr5y4cqnhpyhsmp>\n\nPlease fill it out!  If you have any questions feel free to ask!  Cheers! :tada:I'll be there until 5 - people welcome only if you help clean and organize :sob:Thank you. I'll be heading over there as well to pick it up.<@Corey Harrilal> i believe <@Lorenzo (Enzo) Caoile> and <@Sofia Garcia> are going to be in around 1pHey. Is, by any chance, make school open today?

I was on the J Church line riding into the city coming from the beach in the outer sunset.  An older asian man tries to board the train with a live chicken he had tucked under his arm.  The train operator tells \u201cno pets\u201d.  The man says \u201cIs no pet. Is dinner.\u201d  He tries to enter again.  The operator stops again.  After about 3 or 4 repeats of this exchange, the man takes the chicken out of his arm, breaks its neck until the chicken perfectly still and says \u201cIs not pet, is dinner\u201d and strolls into the train like a boss.\"I've been in SF for a few months now and havent seen much of the city. i've been preoccupied scanning the ground watching my step.\"(Those from Boston, also share a moment to describe Boston's culture)Describe San Francisco's culture in a moment you experienced.

With 18 your somewhat an adult, with 21 a proper one and at 23 you are allowed to take responsibility?Hello everyone! I spoke with Braus regarding gathering volunteers for people who are interested in opening or closing Make School during the week, and possibly weekends. We would be trained by the staff to learn how to use the security system. If you are interested, please send me a message or let me know in person by today so we can coordinate a time for all volunteers to be trained together for the security system. Volunteering would be for the Thanksgiving holiday, and also ongoing for the term. The only other requirement is you have to be over 23. Thank you!<!channel> Makesgiving is ready!

Here is the outline of the group:\n\nGoal: The goal is to apply machine learning on some of the projects we are or might be working on. Why? Because many apps can become much cooler with machine learning! Although ML itself is fun and powerful, it is most exciting when combined with other technologies such as mobile/web apps and IoT. I\u2019m sure you can develop your ideas further just by knowing all the cool things you can do with ML!\n\nPlans: For the first few weeks, we\u2019ll meet up once every week on Thursday during Maker Time for 90min. This will be a time where we study together and ask questions to each other. If you don\u2019t have any background in ML;DS, I\u2019ll try to point you to some resources and answer as many questions as I can.\n\nFuture: If the first few study groups work out, we can ask Alan to be the advisor of the group and advance on actual ML;DS projects.\n\nInterested?: Come to our first study group! You should\u2019ve received a calendar invite. Also, let me know if you have a better idea of making this study group work!\n\nSee you soon!\nKojin<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHrbvNUXz3U>Hi Everyone!

Here\u2019s something weird: please do not provide an excuse for why you won\u2019t be there.

I don\u2019t need to know the details of your personal life. :wink:Parking is going to be a problem.  You can either drive around paying attention to the street signs and hope to find something (can take a little while) or you will have to park it in a paid lot.

One question for anyone in San Fran already: I'll be pulling in to San Fran on the 15th and was wondering where the best place to park would be when I arrive until I can get something more permanent sorted out.

Has the cap changed? Also is it possible to change IBR status while enrolled? Like after the internship could you change to a quarter IBR (from full)?<@Michael Loubier> I would definitely consider either selling the car or parking it somewhere with free unregulated parking and putting it on <http://getaround.com|getaround.com>FYI: I'm traveling and will not have any Internet access for the next ~10 days, so please direct any urgent questions to Braus or Sarah until I return in early September.

I think there's plenty spaces Also, assuming I don't sell the car, I drive a nice big 2012 Toyota Prius V, which is a hatchback with lots of storage space, so I can help transport stuff if anyone needs to bring stuff places for the retreat, or for day trips, or if someone wants me to pick them up on the way to San Fran. HahaQuick question about housing: is there any parking available? If not, what would be the best option for parking in the long term? I'm probably going to end up driving from Georgia to San Fran if I can't get someone to buy my car for what I owe on it.<!channel>: Heads up everyone, please sign the enrollment agreement I sent out yesterday.

Here\u2019s what you need to know:\n\n\u2022 *Retreat (Sep 16-17, Fri-Sat):* A two-day, one-night retreat away from Make School, at NatureBridge in Marin County. The goal is to introduce everyone and have students open up, share your goals/intentions, and start building community. Please contact <@Sarah Hass> with any questions about logistics or arrival/departure timing.\n\n\u2022 *Orientation (Sep 19-23, Mon-Fri):* Your first week at Make School to get everyone oriented and ready to be successful. The goal is to explain how the Product Academy is organized, show curriculum and courses offered, introduce instructor and staff roles, explain rules, set expectations for participation, teach short classes on essential and organizational skills, and kick off the Product Academy with a 24-hour hackathon followed by a short demo day.<@Komal Desai [Marketing]> has joined the channelSure thing!<@Sarah Hass> I don\u2019t think i received the email.

It's just a bunch of bunk beds in a room. I think they split up male and female sleeping areas. Were you able to see the sleeping spaces?The atmosphere at startup housing seems cool. There are well defined rules about were to store personal stuff, where you can/can't make noise, etc. From what I can tell, everyone there gets along well. It is a lot of people living very closely together, so I'm still not sure quite how that will be. The house has most everything you might want, except for private personal space.The students have started a not-for-profit student-run consulting company. Projects you do as contract work are educational and completed on teams and instructors are invited in as advisors to help.<@Alex Dejeu>: the contract work is financially completely independently of Make School.How was it?Yes<@William Wold>: In person?I'm staying in startup house. I just checked it out this morning. <!everyone>:Is anyone here going to be staying in StartupHouse?<@Alex Reilly> has joined the channelHey <@Adam Braus>,  Regarding the Make School supported contract work - do we (the individual students) receive 100% of the proceeds or does Make School take a percentage?  Thanks!Currently Make School is not offering any living expenses scholarships; however, let\u2019s look at what the financial burden is:\n\nEach month costs $1,500-1,800, but during the internship you are taking home enough to break even. Also in the second year, students are expected to be doing Make School supported contract work 20 hours a week and this should have you make more money than your living expenses. So really the only burden is the first 10 months or ~$15,000-18,000. \n\nIf your family and personal savings cannot support this expense during the first year then we can help you find a loan of these costs.Brief breakdown of finances for folks::+1:<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TObfYEwfhtI>Thanks <@Rushindra Sinha>!<@Banta Bernard> has joined the channel<@Artem Layko> has joined the channel<@Tommy Putranto> has joined the channelI'm attending Sunnyvale SA :raising_hand:<@Krish Munot> has joined the channel<@Rushindra Sinha>: oh, ok thenI think he pretty much covered most of the stuff I was askingbut watching the 90 minute intro video <@Adam Braus>  posted so i\u2019m not repeating anything he has already coveredyeah thats what i\u2019m doing lol \u2026 drafting a list of questions xD<@Rushindra Sinha>: just post your question and if someone is able to answer it, he/she will reply ;) <@Marc Clasca> has joined the channelHey is anyone here to answer a few questions i had?<@Jun Hong> has joined the channel<!channel>: I created channels for the sunnyvale and sf Summer Academies (SA).

Facebook has been at the forefront of aggressively monetizing data and have exploited data in ways they agreed they would not do.  Maybe they won't use data to exploit emotionally vulnerable people.  If they change their mind about this, are they going to publicly announce it first?  Might they license others to exploit the data in this way?  What control do we have over how our photos or other data is used once we place them into someone else's hands?  Facebook is often singled out, but the history of just about every kind of business I know of is a history of exploiting whatever they can to expand their revenue, customer base, market share, etc.  Aren't incentives to do that inherent in our system of business?

Later, he will post part two, which sets forth proposed solutions.  <https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-how-capitalism-needs-reformed-ray-dalio>In case you want it, and for those of you who weren't in class yesterday, here is the link to the presentation we watched in class on surveillance in China.  <https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/04/world/asia/xinjiang-china-surveillance-prison.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share>Eat the richChannel.  I'm posting some reading for Friday.Channel.  This looks like something that would interest you:  <https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/01/books/review/clive-thompson-coders.html>Channel.  I want to thank the class for an excellent and provocative discussion yesterday.  Please remember what I hope was clear from our discussion:  that there is no right or wrong answer to these questions about basic fairness.  What is important, at least to me, is that you engage in the type of thoughtful questioning and examination of ideas that most of you participated in yesterday in class before forming your own conclusions.I\u2019m gonna come in a little bit late todaySo excited!@Channel.  What's going on here?  Is this ok?  <https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/21/us/politics/government-hackers-nso-darkmatter.html>@Channel.  Here's a thought provoking article about Theranos from today's Washington Post:  <https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/03/21/can-anyone-crack-elizabeth-holmes/?utm_term=.fca0e5ed743d><https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtDaP18OGfw> this is the trailer for a new documentary about Elizabeth Holmes that just premiered last night on HBO. It looks pretty good!That's very interesting.  I had a friend who starting a company in Russia that tested new drugs for large American and European pharmaceutical manufacturers.  His company became very successful and he made a lot of money.  Unfortunately, he's dead now and I can't ask him about all the ethical issues swirling around the pharmaceutical industry.  He was very intelligent and would have had some good insights.  I'd like to hear more about the movie if anyone else watches it.Well I don't want to ruin the movie but it's about Big Pharma and involuntary drug trials in  Africa... the conspiracies, bribes and government involvement of the entire ordeal..What is the story line?  How does it relate to ethics?I watched a movie on Netflix called the Constant Gardener. If anyone hasn\u2019t seen it, it\u2019s a great movie relating to ethics!@Channel.  This article which appeared today contains a vast trove of concepts, information and questions about data privacy, which we will take up after the break.

On this boat are 100 people that you don\u2019t know. This boat isn\u2019t accessible by phone or anything \u2013 you cannot communicate with anyone on board or anyone else who can assist in the matter. :boat: :busts_in_silhouette:\n\nThe boat has struck an iceberg and is sinking. By taking no action, all 100 people die. :ocean: :skull_and_crossbones:\nIn front of you (on the beach) are two buttons: a *blue* button :large_blue_circle: and a *red* button. :red_circle:\n\n:point_right::large_blue_circle: If you press the *blue* button, you are guaranteed to save 25 random people, or _25% of the boat\u2019s population_. Those 25 random people are teleported off the boat. The other 75 people are left on the boat and doomed to their fate. :smile::skull::skull::skull:\n\n:point_right::red_circle: If you press the *red* button, you have a _25% chance of saving everyone_ on the boat, but you have a _75% chance of saving no one_. :smile::smile::smile::smile: :left_right_arrow: :skull::skull::skull::skull:\n\nIf you do nothing, you do nothing.

Missed my bus. I will be absent today, I have a drs appointment but I will have another student catch me upHas anyone seen the documentary, *Three Identical Strangers* ?\nTons of ethical red flags!Dacio, what is article 13?<!channel> Attached is the article I mentioned in class today, which I want you to read before class next Friday.  Also read the two Facebook/Beacon articles I sent you.  I'll post some philosophy readings also.I'll probably be late, it's taking this restaurant to make my food that I ordered to pickup.Won't make it to class today, at DevFest ExpoI am interested in hearing how you used extensions and programs to block trackers and ads.  Let's discuss in class.  Some sites won't allow use unless ad blockers are disabled.  They say the revenue from ads is necessary in order for the site to be financially viable.  They have a point, but when something \"feels\" like it should be free, people naturally object to having to pay or even receive advertisements.  I pay Pandora a small amount each month so I can listen to music without ads.  It's worth it to me.  Let's discuss in class.If this is what a company publicly failed at hiding I can't imagine what sort of non-consensual tracking that other larger companies like Google are doing. This is why I've actively used extensions and programs to block trackers and ads for years now. Until they make them less intrusive to my privacy I'll block them.I believe that \"internet freedom\" is being able to access and do whatever you like without restriction, of course as you're not doing something illegal or causing harm to others. I know that relatively smaller efforts like the attacks on net neutrality and the proposal of article 13 have both threatened internet freedom. But these \"black boxes\" are a even bigger step in the wrong direction.Here is the second article.  The cover looks almost exactly like the first, but it is the second in a series.  <http://www.corporate-ethics.org/pdf/Facebook%20_B_business-ethics_case_bri-1006b.pdf>Sorry for the late notice.

I should be there by 1:45!I\u2019d like to do it! Will someone please volunteer to read this article, find some additional sources, and do an oral presentation (possibly with PowerPoint) to the class next Friday, Feb. 22:  <https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/13/magazine/women-coding-computer-programming.html?fallback=0&amp;recId=1HDcj4ijaNXe80BNEbXSg9FDmmZ&amp;locked=0&amp;geoContinent=NA&amp;geoRegion=CA&amp;recAlloc=story&amp;geoCountry=US&amp;blockId=signature-journalism-vi&amp;imp_id=938438833>Hacking into private data without any real reason other than personal profit or looking for personal information is wrong to me.\nIf the law enforcement is looking for data important to a case I feel it is alright, but I believe there should be the equivalent to a search warrant if there is not on or if they don't apply already.\n\nI agree with <@Justin Sitter> that if it is white hat hacking as it benefits the company and its users.\nOn a related note, this is why I lean towards open source software if they function similarly. It can be patched for vulnerabilities and also checked for potential misuse or improper handling of data.Security researchers do this. In order to remain ethical they should follow certain minimal standards such as notifying affected parties of any and all found vulnerabilities and giving them enough time to fix said vulnerabilities before releasing their findings to the public.\n\nSecurity researchers shouldn\u2019t actively seek to pilfer sensitive information but instead should  demonstrate that such a task is possible.\n\nSoftware and hardware systems are complex and  making them secure is complicated by the sheer number of ways one can devise to defeat them. White hat hackers probing systems and reporting vulnerabilities is a great thing to have and should not be feared.\n\nWhat you don\u2019t want is a catalog of vulnerabilities, unknown to the developers or manufacturers, kept hidden by shady groups wishing to sell exploits to the highest bidder.I think what you said makes good sense, Justin.  What do you think of hackers testing the security of systems whose owners didn't ask for it?If you want to have a secure service then employing a security professional that will pen test your service is important. It is better to have a professional find and report vulnerabilities than have a black hat find and exploit your vulnerabilities.<@Ferdinand Cruz> has left the channelI definately think this is a debate we often have had recently in the world of tech. I have heard the argument from non tech people of \u201cHow would you like it if somebody walked into your home and just looked at all the information that they wanted to see\u201d, many people have been strongly against the use of digital forensics and allowing the FBI, NSA, and the CIA, but I feel it is absolutely necessary in order to retain a standard of protection for our country. On the otherhand, I think its important that we heavily punish those who attempt to hack into private data for malicious reasons. Personal Data in society is held very dearly to those and Americans value their own privacy.  The debate has gotten even more intense with companies such as Facebook basically running a business model from monetizing off of white should seem like \u201cprivate\u201d data to a users perspective.In my opinion it's something that is situational and needs a context in order to be evaluated.\n\nThere are many cases where agencies like the NSA, FBI, and CIA conduct digital forensic operations under the legal limitations they have which have lead to the arrest of legitimate criminals. In those instances, yes, I believe that it is defensible.\n\nHowever, in the event where some person believes another person is up to something suspicious and then decides to hack them themselves in order to find out, no. It is not defensible nor a responsibility of the person to take the matter into their own hands. Even if they had found evidence of them doing illegal activity, it would certainly be inadmissible in court due to the information being obtained illegally.Yes, maybe..\nI\u2019m tempted to say there\u2019s a time and place.\nOn the other hand, making exceptions can be dangerous ...\nIt\u2019s a slippery slope! More on this later as I form my thoughts.It looks like I just started a thread!Please start a thread and comment on this question and on others' responses:  Is hacking into data people consider private ever defensible?  Why or why not?  (I will also make occasional comments.)<@Stephanie Cherubin> has left the channelCool idea!Dang itLook at me, starting the threadHireplydtest<https://www.technologyreview.com/s/611896/life-as-a-bug-bounty-hunter/>Who wants to team up with me to make some cash <https://venturebeat.com/2019/02/08/google-has-paid-security-researchers-over-15-million-for-bug-bounties-3-4-million-in-2018-alone/><@Richard Kalish [Ethics]> I am so sorry but I\u2019m rather ill today.

Thank you. <@Ebonne Cabarrus> has joined the channelI find this article to be deeply embedded with questions of ethics. I have some experiences working with Doctors on the tech side, and as I believe, I am told that it is illegal for doctors/practices to \u201cgive incentives for referrals of patients  and in the case of the quote in exchange for patient referrals\u201d which seems like an act that shouldn\u2019t be allowed for many reasons. I wonder how this was allowed to happen in the first place?I find it interesting in the part where it briefly talked about Pharmaceutical companies and the relationship to doctors and their prescribing habits staying the same. Even as medication prices sky rocket at the leisure of these companies, people still need the medication, often times to survive. I also find it interesting how conflict of interest is a thing you often see in politics, as politicians and past/current business endeavors often directly cause influence to each other <!channel> before class today, please give some thought to \u201cbug bounties\u201d. Government agencies and large corporations are paying \u201cbounties\u201d who hack into their systems, thus discovering and informing the agency or company of their security vulnerabilities.  Be able to debate both that bug bounties are a good idea and that they should not be used or encouraged. We\u2019ll talk about it in class today. *EmoticonThanks, Vincenzo.  Good system.

If I hadn't known either of them, I most likely wouldn't be able to tell it was fake (However, the facial features are a little rough/weird at certain parts within the clip)I'm curious to hear your reactions to this--if you have time and interest to read and think about the article.  I heard the author interviewed in a podcast.  My impression that some of the participants weren't as genuine as they should have been.  Some said they acted the part they were given so they could get it over with and leave.  I got the sense, though, that those occurrences were limited and that it is an overstatement to say the experiment was a sham.  Of course a distortion of even some of the data can undermine the reliability of the results.

That's almost certainly not what's going on here.  As the quoted language says, incentives undermine objectivity.  (Another way of saying \"Self-interest impairs judgment\"?)

They can both be good for teaching concepts.Maybe another question is why Make School consciously chose our current styles of tutorials? <@Ian Birnam [Curriculum]> :slightly_smiling_face:Adding onto what <@Jasmine Humbert> said the interactive tutorial component of Codeacademy helps me walk through code rather than reading a block of text, then typing out or copy pasting into my code editor and seeing if it works. I really like the controlled learning environment they put you in I guess, not sure exactly what it is tbh.I think the core difference is the way they are chunked and the instant feedback. With codecademy style tutorials you know immediately if you got something right or not. It's light gamification that makes it easier to go through a whole bunch in one sitting.Could you describe what the major difference between Codecademy style tutorials versus Make School ones? What is it about them that makes them a better learning experience?What about Codecademy style? Do u mean having an embedded code editor in the right pane?I wonder if a Codeacademy style of tutorials would prove more useful for students to learn through tutorial rather than the current style.. just an idea<@Stephanie Cherubin> has joined the channel<@Dion Larson [MS PM]> Feature request: It would be really nice if there was a list of \"recent tutorials\" section at the top of <http://makeschool.com/academy|makeschool.com/academy> or <http://makeschool.com/dashboard|makeschool.com/dashboard> so, as a student, I can easily find the tutorials I am currently working on\n\nThe way that page is currently implemented isn't ideal as a PC students for a couple reasons:\n- Tracks take up most of the screen above the fold but tracks are never used by College\n- Tutorials are not sorted by how recently one has viewed them\n- College sometimes keeps tutorials private, so there's no way to find those tutorials other than the deep-link in our course syllabus markdown files.This is from <https://www.makeschool.com/academy/track/react-redux-tetris-app-tutorial-o4s><@Dion Larson [MS PM]> Small styling glitch --&gt; the tutorial steps appear on top of the navbar when scrolling down (see top of screenshot)<@Sukhrobjon Golibboev> has joined the channel<@Thomas Lee> has left the channel<@Thomas Lee> has joined the channel<@Michael (Drew) McGowan> has joined the channel<@Asim Zaidi> has joined the channel<@Ryan Smith> has joined the channel<@Dion Larson [MS PM]> Could we have functionality added to allow us to drag our projects onto the portfolio page in any order, not just at the bottom or the top?

I\u2019ll have them take a look at articles regardless to make sure.Also, just to clarify, this does not happen with article photos as far as I know.Thanks Faith! I\u2019ll make a ticket to take a look at this. Will likely update the CSS for the display so it uses the same rectangular crop since this works for most projects and will make sure all portfolios are compatible.Thank you for all you do!This makes it a little hard to judge photo that you've selected for the portfolio and can result in some awkward looking final images. My suggestion is that it might make more sense for the fixed crop prior to upload to be the same dimensions as the final displayed image.But then, it is displayed on the actual portfolio in a square crop, like this.The website makes you upload the pictures in a fixed, rectangular crop, like this.Hi <@Dion Larson [MS PM]>!

This also means student who only have access to an iPad not a Mac can also participate\n- This year for the first time all winners will receive accommodations as well as ticket, which will significantly reduce financial stress of attending the conference. In addition they can still apply for travel assistance as we did last year to help with the travel expense. \n\nIf you have questions, or would like to discuss issues with their peers or Apple engineers, please direct them to the Scholarship forum for Scholarships. \n<https://developer.apple.com/go/?id=wwdc-scholarship-forum><@Nicolai Safai [Staff]> has left the channelAlexa themed accelerator event: <https://www.eventbrite.com/e/alexa-accelerator-powered-by-techstars-info-session-alumni-mixer-keen-io-tickets-32344255539>Friday 3/10 from 6pm - 10pm there will be a fantastic Hiring Mixer with some of the Bay Area's hottest companies (Facebook, GitHub, NerdWallet, OpenTable, Serverless, Netlify, Eventbrite, Pinterest, &amp; more!)

He's largely responsible for introducing bayesian probabilistic methods into AI in the 80s, and one of the world's foremost experts on things like Markov Logic Networks.  \n\nThe main point behind this book is that current Machine/Deep Learning methods are essentially just glorified curve fitting.  They're not actually doing anything impressive, when compared to human models of cognition, because they're mathematically incapable of inferring causality.  Because x=y, y=x, and we don't know which causes which (an AI can't know if the temperature outside causes the reading on the thermometer, or the reading on the thermometer causes the temperature outside).  He's invented his own form of calculus, do-calculus, that is used to test for and express causality.For anyone looking for a really, really, really good read about the future of AI and machine learning, I highly recommend this book.  \n\n<https://www.amazon.com/Book-Why-Science-Cause-Effect/dp/046509760X/ref=sr_1_1/146-8651237-3070627?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1527875863&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+book+of+why>I just learned about Paperspace, \u201cEffortless cloud infrastructure for Machine Learning\u201d \u2013 <https://www.paperspace.com/>I miss jiro ramen\u2026<https://twitter.com/MIT_CSAIL/status/1001540927456989185>A generative adversarial network (GAN) trained on 60,000 images of ramen created this video continuously interpolating through its latent space could make you hungry or give you nightmares: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnj2RLycHA4>\n\nFound scrolling through Ian Goodfellow\u2019s Twitter stream: <https://twitter.com/goodfellow_ian/status/998616901541482497>Data Science Interview Questions \u2013 Look at questions in these sections: 1.

Read the Keras docs with examples! <https://keras.io/getting-started/sequential-model-guide/>\n\n:three: Finally, it\u2019s time to *select and obtain a dataset for your final project* by next Tuesday\u2019s class.

Apparently he was supposed to be a visiting researcher on the brain team, but a bureaucratic mixup, he was misclassified as one of Jeff Dean's interns :joy:\n\nThe idea of a phD with 35+ years experience as an intern is prettttty hilarious.  Thanks for pointing this out!\n\n<https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/14/geoffrey-hinton-was-briefly-a-google-intern-in-2012-because-of-bureaucracy/>Wasn\u2019t he also the oldest intern at Google? Lol I might have been a bit facetious there.  :wink:\n\nHinton and Rummelhart discovered and published generalized back propagation back in the 80s.  He's arguably the most famous/important name in Deep Learning. Dude has changed the field several times over.  \n\nOnce you all have a strong grasp on CNNs, I recommend taking a look at his talks on his newest findings, Capsule Networks.   Seems like it has the potential to turn computer vision on it's headI'm currently taking his Neural Network class at CourseraHe is a teacher at the University of Toronto^ I dont know her......Geoffrey Hinton?

The universe is the largest thing conceivable to humans and we haven\u2019t explored even a fraction of it. The na\u00efvet\u00e9 we will all share is what is out there. The question. Do you want to dedicate your life to finding out what\u2019s out there or would it be better to come to the conclusion that it\u2019s impossible to find out what is lightlyears away and just forget about  it. The human\u2019a curiosity about outer space has been around for centuries and is documented in almost every ancient civilization. Many theories are given but today\u2019s are the most accurate we have. And tomorrow they\u2019ll be more accurate. And every day we get closer to finding out what is beyond Earth. But will we ever find something worth searching for or is space too large for us to search through?lolWe can't hear you Matt!Learning happens in all parts of life that aren't necessarily explained to us. We can see the effects of a decision. We can learn from how our bodies feel in a moment and by what we don't feel.Organization will be the death of me. According to my head, everything needs a distinct place, separate from everything else. My room is the epitome of tidiness. I can't get out of bed in the morning without worrying I mess up my perfectly neat living space. I have a notebook for each class, a shirt for everyday of the week, and a large color coordinated calendar on my desk that reminds me of everyday's pattern. I micromanage every aspect of my life, segmenting every second of the day. However, I am frequently consumed by the desire to break this dull simulation loop to escape into a realm of chaos. School provides all the discipline and structure I could ever ask for. But overanyalizing my school performance and attempting to optimize myself has beat my personality into a pulp and has left me wallowing in a pool of regret.Monhandas Gandhi has a quote that I really appreciate in which he says something to the effect of \u201cpay attention to the underlying unity of existence, and ignore the differences of ideology, doctrine and modes of thought.\u201d\n\nWhen we approach learning in an organic and holistic way, I think the hope is we may gain some sense of our mutuality (community) as well as an affirming foundation in our own sense of self (being).\n\nFrom this we can start to identify qualities of our own experience that may serve as principles or essential conditions for our continued growth and evolution.\n\nThese might include things like:\nFaith\nFinding balance (within \u2013 and demonstrated by the balance of a board on a wave)\nCuriosity and Joy (as in through ping pong)\nSpace to Breathe (as when I spend days alone in the sierras)\n\nIn fact these are all things that I experience in my own life, and often forget, and then remember again when I join you all in learning, exploring and growing\u2026In the text, he talks about building islands of decency inside the education system. He relates it to the universe being one and a part of the big ball of life. When he says that the education system must be organic I believe he is saying that the education environment needs to be dynamic and constantly changing. The educators need to teach meaningful ideas, and ones they truly believe in themselves.<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_factor_(psychometrics)>let me try my phone for audioPress the settings and make sure that its linked up correctly to your mic and headphonesyou*we cant hear uoucan you hear me&gt;\n?working on my microphoneStarted a <https://makeschoolstudents.slack.com/call/RGUSXGQF8|call>.See you all in a moment !During Sir Ken Robinson\u2019s talk with TED talks, Sir Ken Robinson discusses his opinion on the education system and creativity.

Carstensen, they take the process of aging not a a general decline in facilities, but as a  part of emotional development and growth. Though they tend to take the approach of studying the mental and emotional well-being of the elderly, the way that this paper peeks through the looking glass at these people's experiences, losses, gains, and life stories really explores what it means to mature, journey, and metamorph through life on a large scale.

He tell a classic story about an experiment on willpower with children and marshmallows. Each child is placed in a room with a marshmallow on their plate and they\u2019re told that they can either eat the marshmallow or wait 10 minutes to get a second marshmallow. The children that did pass did their homework, were more popular in school, and were more likely to be successful. This experiment opened up a whole new field on the study of willpower and how it can create success for someone.\n\n\nlink: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMbsGBlpP30>1) Speaking Freely: Bell Hooks <https://youtu.be/g2bmnwehlpA>\n2) 1 Paragraph from Reflection:\nWrite conscious, my mind conscious, the mind thinking, thinking can stop flow. Prosper -  its okay, keep going, you want to no longer be tormented by your past in the future of your life, you want to be conscious of the present, in unwavering waters. So conscious of a mistake and how everyone may have looked at me in that moment. Why did I then so early in my life care so much about my mistakes and what people may have thought. I think it is what I learned very early on about self. Through tv, I saw people look for attention and get it. I saw people look for others to see them as they\u2019re doing things.Homework *Due Friday 22st*:\n1)  Post *Youtube Video* or other media related to the subject of your Paper with *1 Paragraph* from your Reflection to this <!channel>\n2) Direct message Matt 1 Page Reflection via slack or emailHere's a paper on it.<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4179616/><@Novan (Donny) Adams> has joined the channel<@Salvador Becerra> has joined the channel<@Matthew Phraxayavong> has joined the channel<@Marianna Campbell> has joined the channel<@Jonathan Kopp> has joined the channel<@Jake Shams> has joined the channel<@Erik Perez> has joined the channel<@Victoria Murray> has joined the channel<@Samuel Harrison> has joined the channel<@Rushani Shawuti> has joined the channel<@Luc Boettner> has joined the channel<@KJ Wilson> has joined the channel<@Matt Davis [Writing]> has joined the channel<@Anne Spalding> set the channel purpose: SL ENGL 1004 : Writing Class : Matt Davis<@Anne Spalding> has joined the channel"

I currently have that setting on 'disabled' which allows students to show up as anon to classmates but not to instructors. To echo what <@Ian Birnam [Curriculum]> said, with the correct intention, anon posting is definitely one of the main features I previously found useful as a student due to fear of \"asking stupid questions\".i\u2019d caution to not completely turn off anon posting, cause then some students are afraid to ask questions (feel stupid, afraid of backlash, usual question fears). We tried that before too, and it greatly reduced the number of questions asked. best compromise we found was to allow anon posting, but instructors could still see who was postingThx Ian!!!<@Brian Nguyen [TA]> can we turn off anonymous posting of any kind?^ <@Brian Nguyen [TA]> <@Adam Braus>, not sure which of you is leading thisI\u2019ve used this at previous teaching jobs to huge success with students (albiet this was years and years ago). One thing to keep in mind though: as great as a tool as it is, anonymous posting can lead to some pretty toxic conversations if things aren\u2019t moderated. Be wary of that.\n\nAlso there used to be an admin setting that allowed for students to post anonymously to everyone (students + staff) or just to students (i.e. if a student posts anonymously, other students will see \u201canon\u201d, while staff will see the name. I found the later greatly reduced toxic convos since students still knew that staff knew who was saying stuffYou can also sign up via this link <http://piazza.com/makeschool.com/spring2019/ms101|piazza.com/makeschool.com/spring2019/ms101>Hi <!channel>, PIAZZA IS UP &amp; AVAILABLE FOR TESTING :bangbang: If you are not familiar with Piazza, it\u2019s a really great product used by many schools (especially for Comp Sci courses) as a platform to ask for help and/or offer help to other students. Ideally this would be :make-school:\u2019s version of :stackoverflow:StackOverflow where you can also see if someone else previously encountered a similar problem and how they went about solving it.

If they do all the typing, then they generally get more out of the interaction. Try it :smile:Happy to lead it, will DM you for some clarifications soon!Hello TAs!  I've been working with some students who have been getting a lot of TA support (YEAH).  I asked them if when a TA unblocked them did they understand what the TA did (ie searched google, read the errors, looked in documentation, ....) or if it *\"Felt Like Magic\"* .\n\nThey all said there were times when it *\"Felt Like Magic\"*.  So - I asked them that the next time that happens to ask the TA to do it again / slower so that they understand and it no longer seems like magic.  They were nervous to do this since they are so thankful for your help, but agreed to try\n\nLetting you all know so if you get the request to \"Do it again so it doesn't feel like magic\" you'll know.   When we unblock students, the most important part is that they learn from the process and get better at unblocking themselves.\n\nThanks for all the support you give students!Does anyone want to lead it?Hey team, do we want to open up the Make School stackoverflow building to the whole student body?<@Novan (Donny) Adams> has left the channelstraight cloneYou could, or just use stackoverflow as a wireframeShould we wireframe it first?Has anyone started MakeOverflow yet?thx np<@Adam Braus> FYI - I\u2019m not abe to join the Feb 18th meeting as I have an onsite scheduled for that day.We announced at All Hands 2 weeks ago that all instructor and TA office hours are now on the College calendar: <http://make.sc/calendar|make.sc/calendar>We\u2019re in tea tree torteis TA meeting still happening?I've been sending them the link but thus far it's been ignored<!channel> Hey folks, I\u2019m noticing that some students are struggling with knowing when/where we have TA office hours. :timer_clock: :question:\n\nSome of them are referencing the old TA docs at <http://make.sc/tutoring|make.sc/tutoring>, but it\u2019s not up-to-date.

Great work everyone and remember to crank up your own expectations and timelines as we finish out this summerFYI: I reported the issue we found of not being able to add tutorials to our web team and they investigated it this morning.

It isn\u2019t as convenient and fancy as Atom, but it sure is useful :ok_hand::skin-tone-5::\n\n<https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint>The instructors have adopted a policy to use a linter with a default industry standard style guide for all project tutorials and sample code. This will enforce good code quality and best practices, plus help learners grok language syntax faster.\n:javascript: Mitchell and Braus recommend using Airbnb\u2019s JavaScript and React style guides, as they are top of industry.\n:python: I recommend Python\u2019s standard PEP 8 style guide and the `autopep8` tool to automatically format your code.\n:swift: Does Xcode automatically complain or fix Swift code to conform to Apple\u2019s style guide, or are there other tools?I\u2019ve given everyone access to our package that renders tutorial Markdown locally using Atom using the same CSS as the Make School website.

If you want to know what the average height of Californians is you probably can\u2019t measure everyone in the state so you might measure like 100 people and pretend the average of them is the average height of all Californians. Confidence interval is the range that you think, with some percent certainty, the real average is in. So where the point estimation for average height of Californians might be 5\u20198, the confidence interval might be that you are 95% sure the average is between 5\u20197 and 5\u20199.Ok I still don't really understand what confidence intervals are.No problem <@Nathan Pillai> thanks for the heads up!so finals and then presentations?Milad did say WednesdayI thought Milad said Wednesday?are we lecturing?

Please feel free to go through this page and play around with it!\n\nKDE Explained and Visualized: <https://mathisonian.github.io/kde/>Modified version of the notebook explaining what the variables mean<!here> *GMMs Explained*:\n\n\u201cImagine that a researcher gives you a data set to analyse consisting of the measured heights of 100 adults. The problem is, the researcher _failed to distinguish between *males* and *females*_ when taking measurements. When you plot the distribution of heights you see *two clear peaks* - most likely corresponding to a peak in male heights and a peak in female heights. Unfortunately, it is difficult to see from this messy data _what is the average height of men and the average height of women_, and it is even *more difficult* to say if a particular observation was a man or a woman in retrospect.\n\nAfter firing your researcher, you may want to turn to `Gaussian mixture models` (GMMs) for a practical solution. A GMM assumes that the observed data is made up of a mixture of several Gaussian distributions. These individual distributions (referred to as mixture components) may be given _different means and variances (square of standard deviations)_. They may also be given _different mixture weights_. The final distribution is obtained by multiplying each mixture component by its associated mixture weight before and adding them together (mixture weights must sum to one). In this example we would want two Gaussian distributions - one for men and one for women - with different means and perhaps different variances, and where the mixture weights correspond to the probability of a random individual being male or female (roughly 0.5 in each case).\u201d\n\nSOURCE: Research Gate (<https://www.researchgate.net/post/How_does_GMM_work_in_principle>)yea looks like the limit on a single message is 5050It let me do 13```\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sklearn import mixture\n\n# Generate data samples and plot its histogram\nx_1 = np.random.normal(-5, 1, 3000)\nx_2 = np.random.normal(2, 3, 7000) \nx = np.concatenate((x_1, x_2))\nplt.hist(x, bins=20, density=1)\nplt.show()\n\n```Is there a limit to how many emojis you can use to react to a message?

In statistical/scientific research, we always want to make sure that the *relationship between our variables* is significant and is _not caused by chance/other variables_.\n\nSo we define a `NULL HYPOTHESIS` that states that our statistical test may in fact be caused by chance or other (confounding) variables. Remember, in statistics, we\u2019re not necessarily trying to *prove* that there\u2019s a relationship between two variables as much as we\u2019re trying to start out by *disproving* that there\u2019s no relationship between our variables (that allows us to look deeper!).\n\nAn example is with the drug effect on mice study. If we\u2019re researching the effect of a drug on mice, we\u2019re assuming that the drug actually *has an effect* on the mice. So our null hypothesis states that the drug *doesn\u2019t* have an effect on the mice! And we actively try to *disprove the null hypothesis*.\n\nBe sure to _read this article_ to gain an even better understanding on the NULL HYPOTHESIS (this article helped me learn it very well!): <https://byrslf.co/the-null-hypothesis-loves-you-and-wants-you-to-be-happy-3189413d8cd0>Reminder: Add your notes to the open source class document <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oxVG0uFT_y72cBSHuFdFhg9aBj3QNmT2q0PfEFSiOmg/edit?usp=sharing>Is anyone from DS around? looking for helpHey <!channel>, will be moving my Office Hours today till later.

I was improving the instructions in the course repo.On a side-note: it\u2019s submit a GitHub pull request from a clone using GitHub\u2019s tool `hub` (<https://hub.github.com/>)Is there any particular reason why we must have *two* repositories for this course?\n\nI feel the better is as follows:\n1. Clone the course repo to a folder called \u201cData-Analysis\u201d with `git clone <https://github.com/Make-School-Courses/DS-1.1-Data-Analysis.git> Data-Analysis`\n2. Create a new repo on GitHub called `Data-Analysis`\n3. Set the origin remote on your clone to your new repo with `git remote set-url origin <https://github.com/&lt;your-username&gt;/Data-Analysis.git>`\n4. Push your clone to the new repo with `git push`\n5. Add the original course repo as a different remote with `git remote add upstream <https://github.com/Make-School-Courses/DS-1.1-Data-Analysis.git>`\n6. Update with `git pull upstream master` when you want new course materials.\n\nThis is slightly than the process in Setup.md (<https://git.io/fhw3a>), but you only have *one* repo and track your GitHub streaks.\nI got this workflow from GitHub\u2019s User documentation (<https://git.io/vhZ3E>), in this case I changed the origin of my clone to be my own repo instead of cloning a GitHub fork.\nI believe there is no difference to Git between a fork and how I did it, I think it just tells GitHub to allow their special UI pull requests which we likely won\u2019t need.<@Novan (Donny) Adams> has joined the channel<https://github.com/Make-School-Courses/DS-1.1-Data-Analysis/tree/master/Notebooks/Datasets>Oh....

Happy to chat tomorrow around then.<@Aakash (Kash) Sudhakar> <@Novan (Donny) Adams> i noticed your calendars are free after 1:30p, I\u2019d like to ask a very specific question on my dataset. Are either one of you available for 15-30mins?Perhaps a better picture showing why this can happen: The third picture is color coded where small x-values is darker and large x-value is lighter.  On the third picture we still see that when y increase x increases (the color gets lighter), and the same for when z increases. However, since in the third pic we collapse the x variable to product a 2d plot of y versus z, it happens that y and z alone are not correlated.For 3 variables x, y, and z, it is possible that x,y and x,z are positively correlated, but y,z is not. The picture I've attached is an example of distribution on 3 variables x,y,x which is jointly normal.  For x vs. y and x vs. z, there is a positive correlation (.5 in both cases), but when we plot y vs. z, the correlation is 0.I was looking at the 2016 happiness report and something doesn't make sense about the data:\n\nI found out the the more GDP a country has the more freedom they have.\nAlso the more freedom a country has the more Generosity they have.\n\nNaturally I concluded that GDP and Generosity must also be related, but when I plotted the data I found that it is not in fact so.\n\nHow can that be? Pls Help<@Ansel Bridgewater> <@Kuan-Ying Fang> Super helpful. Now I understand better. Getting more fun :slightly_smiling_face:That\u2019s right. I knew I was going to make a mistake somewhere there.0.1% is 0.001 instead of 0.1, so 3 deviations out will imply rejection of null at 0.05 level (95% confidence). In the limit where t-distribution is approximately normal, the t-score for 0.05 level is roughly 2 (for 2 sided) and roughly 1.65 (for 1 sided)One more thing that I think is important is reading the t-stat. I believe the t-stat is suppose to represent a number of std deviations away from the mean of the t-distribution. This t-distribution will be normal. If we look at a representation of the 68\u201395\u201399.7 rule, we can see that there is a 0.1% chance that a single sample point lands beyond the third distribution. The p-value, in this case, will be the area under the curve beyond the t-stat, so if we look beyond 3 standard deviations on the left side, the p-value would be 0.1, which is too high for us; however, you said that the t-stat is around -12, so if we calculate the area under the curve beyond the 12th standard deviation on the left side, we get a super small p-value, which means we can reject the null hypothesis.thank you for your help!you\u2019re right\u2026haha i got it!ahhThe e-27 is scientific notation, so the number is not 6.31, but rather .0000\u2026 (total of 26 zeros) \u2026000631mmm, confusingstatistic=-12.5378877969598756.317910513875817e-27Ok, we got the same number.

I'll be spending some time before and after class perusing through and making sure we're all wrapped up! It's imperative that your projects are completed to the best of your ability, as we'll be attacking new content throughout the next few weeks and we don't want anyone to fall behind. :npm: :shrug::skin-tone-5: :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes: :timer_clock:\n\nSpeaking of which, it is worthwhile pointing out that it's been a little bit of time since many of you have seen material on z-scores, sampling distributions, and the standard normal curve. We'll take some time during class today to review some material before diving headfirst into more complex applications. :bar_chart: :chart_with_downwards_trend: :chart_with_upwards_trend: :smile:\n\nIn order to get the most out of class today, please _please_ *PLEASE* finish up these readings before class.

Just wanna make sure y\u2019all are unblocked and moving at a good pace. I\u2019m available remotely but am happy to FaceTime/FB Chat or screenshare via Skype. <@Uchenna Aguocha> <@Johnathan Chen> <@Willie Johnson> <@Erick Sanchez>\n\nTwo big reasons we want the entire project wrapped up and done by Tuesday are as follows:\n\n1. New content starts on Tuesday and it\u2019s definitely gonna be some of the most challenging content we\u2019ve had this term. It\u2019s gonna require a full retrospective understanding of all the data analysis/descriptive stats stuff we\u2019ve done over the past few weeks so we definitely wanna make sure there\u2019s no baggage left.\n\n2. Based on the creativity and in-depth-ness of your analyses/visualizations, I\u2019m going to encourage and work with students over the next few weeks to push their NPS notebooks as kernels on Kaggle, so they can start having projects on their Kaggle portfolio (think of it like GitHub for Data Science). I\u2019d love if everyone could have their projects up there!Yeah <@Alan Davis [CS]> I thought the same but it was just the aliasesNah, we got it resolved. Was one of the issues where when terminal restarted, temporary aliases for the commands `jupyter` and `conda` were reset and the CLI didn't know where to look. We just had to redefine the PATH for `jupyter` and `conda` and everything was fine.Wait, how have you been doing any of the challenges in class without `jupyter` installed?!<@Aakash (Kash) Sudhakar> srry i wasn\u2019t clear, but `jupyter` is not installed on my computer. but I followed the steps to install jupyter and the same result occurrsMake sure the `my-project.ipynb` is replaced with the appropriate file location from where you're running that command from!was anyone able to build their slides using `jupyter nbconvert my-project.ipynb --to slides --post serve` ??Reminder that presentations are today! Make sure you have some interesting data wrangling and visualization material to show off!<!channel> Heads-up that presentations for the Summer NPS project are TOMORROW! Please make sure you\u2019ve completed both a data wrangling and data visualization investigation. If you get stuck, refer back to the Data Science Process and check back through your notes to look for types of questions or investigations you can do. Feel free to work with each other or ask myself or <@Novan (Donny) Adams> for any assistance.\n\nAlso, please check the progress tracker for challenges related to *presenting your findings* tomorrow. Particularly, you\u2019ll find two articles as _Required Readings_ essential for setting up Jupyter Slides if you wish to present that way. I\u2019d love if at least 1-2 students (if not more) present using Jupyter\u2019s in-built slideshow format! Message me for any assistance if you\u2019re trying to set it up!Hey guys! ive been doing this book in the off time just to make sure that my math is up to date( and my python)yeahhhYay!

Don\u2019t forget that we have a progress check-in today (don\u2019t worry if you\u2019re not too far, this is the time to get unblocked and redirected). Will leave around 2pm though so if you have any quick questions, please stop by!Tomorrow\u2019s primarily a work session for the Summer Academy NPS Project, so we\u2019ll have plenty of time to sort out all the assignments/challenges for the tracker!\n\nAnd good catch! :slightly_smiling_face: Fixing that now.

Don\u2019t worry: we\u2019ll be covering environment setup for the first 5-10 minutes of class.\n\nThe main tools we\u2019ll be using are Anaconda and Jupyter Notebooks. Jupyter Notebooks are a data visualization and analysis tool that allows you to manipulate datasets to your liking through a web-based application. Much of the industry favors the use of Jupyter Notebooks for easy-to-use, clean usage.Some of the things you can hope to find out are things like : Is this data weird? How often does this happen? What are the chances of X happening during Y?We\u2019re honored to get to teach you all. DS 1.1 focuses on Introductory Data Analysis and Visualization.

As I said in class. My parents are arriving Friday morning. Would you mind if they joined along on the field trip?<@Duncan MacDonald> has left the channelONE PAGER:\nHalf a billion people around the world live in areas at risk from volcanic eruptions, in that they live in an area that would be directly affected by a volcano that is active or dormant. There is little in terms of hazard mitigation (such as earthquake building codes or tornado basements) that can protect life and property in the event of an eruption. Volcanic eruptions are a perfect example of a \u201chigh impact/low probability\u201d event. This means that the chance of an eruption occurring during any one person\u2019s lifetime is quite low, but the repercussions of that event could be devastating.\nPeople don\u2019t have a natural feeling for what is risky and what isn\u2019t (how strong one risk is compared to another) so when people do want to make decisions about risk, they can\u2019t rely on their gut, they need  to rely on analytics. These high impact/low probability events are the most difficult to deal with and address as everyday risks and needs often make this sort of long term danger seem less important. Much of the mitigation strategy revolves around community mobilization during an event. But false alarms can be costly in terms of lost business and displacement costs. Other hazards (like drunk driving and flu epidemics) may feel more pressing in the moment. How should society deal with these rare but deadly events? Should we always err on the side of caution, even if that has its own embedded costs? What would we (in the US) do if there was a devastating eruption in a major US city, like Seattle? How do differing circumstances affect how people might look at this problem,thinking about the risks in places like Iceland, Japan, and the US, where there are relatively robust resources compared with places in Africa where resources are more scarce? In areas with large yearly death tolls from other issues (lack of clean water, poor sanitation, political unrest) is there any point to long term disaster planning?here is the assignemnt:<@Nolan Kovacik> has joined the channelhi all-- we are expecting a storm tomorrow that is going to bring a good amount of rain. The point of the earthquake field trip is to have a good time looking at neat stuff and talking about cool concepts-- if it is unpleasant out, it won\u2019t be as much fun. The storm is certainly coming- but timing is always the variable. Let\u2019s meet tomorrow, and if it seems like a wet day, we can swap the next two lectures-- and postpone the field trip to next week.

Hope ya'll have fun though!I'll be a little late to the gamegoing to take a rain check. Something bad happened today and I want time to process. Definitely interested for the next round though.<!channel> Fate game starting at 5pm at Vantaggio, going until 9pm. Emoji if you're coming!It's going to be an experimental world building session and we'll see where we want to take it from there. I anticipate we'll take longer than we have to actually play a one-shot but if we get to actual play we can do that as well.Now I\u2019m jealous lol! I\u2019d like to play this Friday :sob:Oh, were you planning on doing more than a one-shot?\n\nI played a derivative of it based on the Dresden Files, and will say it\u2019s SIGNIFICANTLY heavier on roleplaying elements, creativity and the theatre-of-the-mind. There\u2019s also a lot more creativity involved, a lot less constraints. Would very much recommend.Ok the more I read about it the more excited I am to play fate with you all. For the experimental session we'll just be doing world building and maybe get to character creation.\n\nIn preparation, you can think about genres in fiction you like and what elements you think are important. We could play in a D&amp;D-like fantasy land, a cyberpunk dystopia, treasure planet universe, a western with cowboys and train chases, or anything you can come up with. For example, the last time I played fate my group decided we really like space operas and had to decide if we wanted aliens in our world, how sophisticated AI is, and what kind of government structure we wanted our galactic society to have.\n\nAlso think about what kind of characters you enjoy playing: what kind of hero do you want to be? what role do you like playing in a party? what kind of trouble do you like to make? In fate you basically have infinite flexibility on what type of character you can play. The only restrictions are the ones we decide on as a group. My party ended up being a genetically constructed superhuman with a brain injury, a broken military AI who cannot harm humans under any circumstance, one accidental clone (out of thousands) of a random college girl from the rich people planet, and a 12 year old street rat computer prodigy.\n\n<https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/character-creation>^^I'm down.Yo everyone so Nolan won't be here Friday. How would you all feel about trying the Fate system? As opposed to DnD it's more of a group story telling tabletop rpg where we all collectively decide what the world is like and then create characters to place into it. I've played it once before and had a great time.\n\nThe rules are simple yet kinda weird but easy to learn if you take it step by step. I can explain them all on the day of but if anyone wants to read through the rules beforehand see the attached PDF.\n\nAnyhoo, emoji up this post if you're interested.missing this week's DnD. My time got eaten up by headshotsBut for now I'm at the talks I definately canBut if enough people want to start like NOWI'm not sure how many people will be in lightning talks but I'm right up by the podium. Hey all!! I'm in the great hall right now <!here> I've been coding like a madman today and may in fact be able to go to DnD tonight. When does it start?I think we're the last two lightning talks too. Each one is ~5 minutes and there are maybe 6-8 people lined up. I would not be too sad if you started without me.<@Faith Chikwekwe> <@Jasmine Humbert>\nWell, we have some options.\n- Play some other game up until the point where you two come\n- Start without you and just play it by ear\n\nIts up to what everyone wants. If more people are interested in the lightning talks, then I\u2019m inclined to join them myself at that point!^ dittoAlso, I'm doing a lightning talk so I'll be late anyway<@Nolan Kovacik> They're doing lightning talks in the great hall until 5:45pm. Are we gonna wait until after the talks?But yep! We are doing dnd for everyone else wondering. Depending on if Jen will be joining us today, we will be in the great hallNo problem!

Open Legend Character Creation is much easier and provides even more avenues for customization and awesome stuff. I apologize for the confusion. I didn\u2019t know about Open Legend until yesterday, but I can tell you that it fits our campaign and the various skill levels of our group even better than Fantasy AGE. Sorry to confuse everyone with that. Last time it\u2019s changing, I promise. \n\nWe need to schedule a time to go over the rules, character creation, and gameplay mechanics with everyone at some point. If you could fill out the doodle with times/dates that work for you, I can meet with everyone at once, or a couple groups of people if that\u2019s easier. \n\n<http://doodle.com/poll/i7xm8uquqhd77md8><!channel> For a more customized experience, there\u2019s also the Open Legend system, just newly released, that uses lots of dice and a cool \u201cexploding dice\u201d mechanic that lets you reroll and add any die that rolls max value. It allows for much more character customization, so there\u2019s a bit more information, but it, like Fantasy AGE, is designed to allow new players to jump in fairly easily. I\u2019m researching it a bit more now to see which might be better for the group, but feel free to check out the website (<http://www.openlegendrpg.com/>) for more inspiration for your characters!<!channel> One last note for those of you concerned about how many options there can be in a game like this: Fantasy AGE makes this really REALLY simple: there are only 3 starting classes: Mage, Rogue, Warrior. Specializations evolve from there, and character customization options are nearly limitless. Beyond the options in the book, there may be opportunities for players to earn additional skills, stat boosts, and bonuses outside the normal methods for acts of great roleplay, Really Cool Shit (RCS)(TM), and other scenarios events! The rule of cool lives here!Read it! Learn it! Love it!<!channel> Alright you tabletop RPG nerds! Listen up! From what I\u2019ve gathered, we\u2019re pretty much over creating the world and most people are ready to play. This is great! I\u2019m excited that you are excited! \n\nHowever, only a couple of people have approached me and asked about their characters or asked questions about the game! I take this to mean that only a couple people are really seriously interested in playing. This is fine! I don\u2019t expect everyone to play, nor do I think I could successfully guide everyone who expressed interest without some help! I just need to know who wants to play, who wants to spectate, and who wants to just jump in every once in a while to play a recurring character. If you want to play, and can commit to playing frequently (once every 1-2 weeks) then you will be part of the core group. Anyone not part of the core group is welcome to join whenever they are available! And people may come and go from the core group over time. That\u2019s fine! I just need to know who actually wants to play! \n\nTo that end, I\u2019m providing 2 pdfs below that include all of the necessary information for players to learn everything you want to know about the system we\u2019re going to be playing. Do I expect you to read all of it? Of course not, but the more you do read, the better prepared you will be. I\u2019m happy to answer any questions you might have, and many questions will surely be asked in the first few sessions of play. \n\nLuckily, the Fantasy AGE system is incredibly easy (specifically designed to be playable even for people who are completely new to RPGs) to make characters with, so the number one thing I need everyone to do is simply figure out who you want to play! There are several races and classes available in the books! Pick a combination that seems cool to you and makes sense and we will make it work! (Obviously, any mention to \u201ccomputers\u201d or \u201cblasters\u201d or other future tech will be replaced with an equivalent version in our own campaign). \n\nFor those of you who are a little more advanced or who want to take it a step further, if there is a specific race or class that does not exist in these books that you would like to explore, talk to me! If you are willing to put in the effort to make it happen, I am absolutely willing to make that happen for you! I want you to have fun just as much (if not more!) than you do! That\u2019s my entire job as your Game Master, and I couldn\u2019t be more excited!\n\n\nSo get pumped! Be excited! AND LET\u2019S ROLL THOSE DICE!!!!I AM A PRIVATE PERSONGithub repo for shared documents. Anything you want public (character images, inventory lists, notes, artwork you\u2019ve made\u2026etc.) goes here.<https://github.com/Hassurunous/MakeSchoolRPGGroup>:game_die: With dming details, I don't think we need another entire session dedicated to worldbuildingI\u2019m probably going to use the Fantasy AGE system (linked the pdf above), with a few custom modifications.Have we decided on the System yet?Shoot me character ideas, questions, concerns, or anything else you are curious about! I\u2019ve already had a couple requests for custom classes/races, including some pretty neat ability options, and we\u2019ve discussed ways to make sure that nobody feels over/under-powered. I can meet with everyone individually to talk about their characters, if you\u2019d like, I just need you to set a time that works for you and send me a calendar invite. If you bring some research you\u2019ve done about the idea you have, all the better, but if not, we can certainly look it up together! My calendar should be publicly viewable, and pretty much the same as everyone else\u2019s, so feel free to come see me if you have any questions at all!<!channel> Hey guys! Today didn\u2019t end up happening, but that\u2019s alright! I still want to give everyone the opportunity to contribute to the world creation, so I\u2019ve put together another doodle to find a time/day that works for everyone. If we\u2019d rather just stop the exercise now, you can instead vote here (use the :game_die: to vote for this option) and I can instead have everyone who still wants to contribute pm me their ideas instead. Fill out the doodle and/or vote here with :game_die: to move past the world-building group game.I'm down for now lol, tbh just forgot lolsame, working on code in the castro right now :rainbow:count me out for today<!channel> meeting on whenever you guys get here.Down for 4pm<!channel> Another note! Although the PDF I linked is the system we will be using, don\u2019t feel like you are limited to what is in the PDF! Custom races, classes, abilities, spells\u2026etc. are all up for grabs! Just run them by me first so I can look into them to find something similar that has been playtested a bit, and we can work out a way to implement it. If you want to be a gunslinger, if you want to channel divine energies, if you want to channel demons, if you want to be a necromancer\u2026etc. it\u2019s all possible! Just send me a message, or come talk to me in 505 and we\u2019ll figure out some way to do it! Feel free to scour the internet for inspiration or build something completely new!<@Michael Loubier>: 4 is fine for me! Thanks for putting in so much effort!The description, from the document is: Going around the group, each player will create one \u201cEra\u201d or one \u201cEvent\u201d. An Era describes a time period for the world, while an event describes some notable event within an Era. After everyone has had a turn, the next player in the order becomes the \u201cLens\u201d and drafts a \u201cFocus\u201d for this round of play. \n\nThe \u201cFocus\u201d describes what you want the group to focus on describing during this round of play. It can be as wide or narrow in scope as you want. You\u2019re the \u201cLens\u201d! The \u201cLens\u201d, after determining the \u201cFocus\u201d, can take a \u201cnested\u201d action, meaning he/she can place two Eras, Events, or Questions, but must post their second inside the first (i.e. An Era and an Event, an Event and a Question). \u201cQuestions\u201d are questions about a particular Event that the person can answer themselves, or they can ask for an answer from the group, or even a particular member. A \u201cQuestion\u201d can also be acted out as a \u201cScene\u201d, in which the players will all get involved in a particular story within the timeline to determine the direction of events! Once the round has completed, and it comes back to the \u201cLens\u201d\u2019s turn, he/she can make another nested action, a single action, or pass their turn.<@David Ciaffoni> If you check out the document I linked above (which I\u2019ll link again here), it\u2019s a part of the game we were playing to build the world of the game we\u2019ll be playing. <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-VIkz94sbjUzfzC_9xs5v9H2KE_2j-ML0OdNW39AIdQ/edit#>Also, if you guys want to use cool miniatures (or even just card stock miniatures) let me know! I know several places where I can buy dozens of cool minis for both your own characters and for the monsters and baddies we will face. I\u2019ve also found a cool campaign setting that I can adapt to the game, but I have to buy it first, so that\u2019s another expense that I\u2019d like to ask for help with. If you guys want to chip in, just shoot me a message, or send me few bucks on Venmo with \u201ctabletop games\u201d in the comments, and I\u2019ll start setting money aside for cool props, including maps, miniatures, books, music, and more!What's a lens?This is probably the system we are going to use. I have a ton of other resources for it, including character sheets, cheat sheets, cool dungeon- and world-making tools, and more.<@Fiona Carty> has joined the channel<!channel> Going to start setting up at 4. We\u2019ll start as soon as we have enough people. <@Fiona Carty> was our next Lens, then ross, me, enzo, nemo, bob. (I think I might be missing one of the people who was there at the end, but I\u2019m not sure). We don\u2019t have to make it through everybody if we decide as a group that it is enough, but I want to at least make sure that everyone has their say, gets to create their own Legend/Icon, and is engaged with the story. \n\nGiven how many people have decided to join, we will probably have to run two groups, unless the \u201ccore group\u201d (the group that shows up every time/nearly every time) is small enough. We\u2019ll deal with that when the time comes. \n\nIf you have a cool idea for a character, great! Send me your ideas! I can help you build something fun and engaging! Or, if you don\u2019t have an idea for a character, or you want to let Fate decide what kind of character you want to play, you can do that as well. Fate characters will have the potential to be stronger than built characters, but can also be weaker. They are a gamble! PM me if you are interested!Don\u2019t forget guys! Tomorrow afternoon (I\u2019m thinking around 4) we\u2019re going to be finishing up the creation of the world. You\u2019re welcome to send ideas after that, and I will incorporate them if they make sense, but I\u2019m already filled to the brim with cool, fun, awesome ideas that I can\u2019t wait to share with the group! Let me know if 4 works for you. If so, we\u2019ll probably meet in the common area. See you there!<@Jimmy Hsu> I\u2019mma star without you<@Ali Shalabi [Staff]> I brought board games and stuff if you guys want to play. I invited everybody, but I\u2019m not sure who all plans on hanging out.<!channel>: don't forget, if you want to participate in the rpg game, we're doing world-building after lightning talks today. Come find me in the main room and we'll figure out where to meet.Here is the instructions we\u2019ll be using to do the world-building today, for those of you playing D&amp;D. I\u2019ll explain it more when we get started, and I\u2019ll be taking notes for it. <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-VIkz94sbjUzfzC_9xs5v9H2KE_2j-ML0OdNW39AIdQ/edit?usp=sharing>Same tbhAfter Lightning Talks it isYeah after lighting talks is good for me!Also, anyone else who wants to play some tabletop rpg (such as d&amp;d) is welcome to join.<@Bob De Kort>  <@Nehemiah Igbadumheodior> <@Luca Hagel>  <@Jimmy Hsu> Let me know what you guys are thinking. After LT's sounds good to me. Eithers fine<!channel> Anyone playing D&amp;D: I'm going to try to have us meet either tonight after lightning talks or Sunday afternoon for our first session, just to discuss rules, what game system we're going to use...etc. and also to build the lore for our campaign. I'm going to be writing the adventures myself, but I want to get everyone together for a really cool exercise I found that will allow you all to be a part of building the world we play in. Ali has invited us to hang out after lightning talks, so if that works for you, then fantastic! If not, let me know, and, depending on how many people will be absent, we may postpone it to the original plan of Sunday. See you guys there!<@Michael Loubier> has renamed the channel from \"851_tabletop_games\" to \"tabletop_games\"I'll bring my stuff! If we want to do it tomorrow, I'll be prepared!How\u2019s about tomorrow after lightning talks?<@Michael Loubier>: any dates in the works for the first session yet?:+1: We\u2019ll go wherever is easiest for you all!<@Sarah Hass> Also, if staff want to play and are okay with it, we can organize to meet after class at Make School instead (if a staff member with the code is staying) so there is more space and accessibility for anyone who wants to be involved. Totally up to you guys though!<@Sarah Hass> Of Course! We\u2019d love to have you guys join!<@Kadeem Palacios> has joined the channelKeep us posted on dates and we\u2019ll have staff swing by (if you\u2019ll have us :slightly_smiling_face:)!<@Sarah Hass> has joined the channelAbsolutely!
