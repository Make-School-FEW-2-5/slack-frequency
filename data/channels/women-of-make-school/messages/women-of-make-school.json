And we couldn't be more excited about it! For the first time pretty much ever, the Girl Geek community will get to hear from the women who started it all: Girl Geek X Founder &amp; CEO Angie Chang, plus other core members of the GGX team: Sukrutha Bhadouria and Gretchen DeKnikker, plus podcast producer Rachel Jones! :two_women_holding_hands::two_women_holding_hands:\n\nIn the weekly podcast, we are highlighting and distilling our learnings from across* 200+ dinners, 1000+ speakers, over 5,000 audience questions,* and we're sharing our own collective and individual experiences as women working in the Bay Area tech scene.\n\nWe're tackling the tough issues, the stuff we ALL struggle with, and the topics we most frequently hear discussed at GGX Dinners &amp; events: mentorship, career transitions, management, imposter syndrome, and so much more. We're also pushing ourselves and each other to examine our own weaknesses, biases, and mistakes during our weekly podcast chats -- so we'll be learning right along with you -- and having a ton of fun doing it! :tada::star:\n\nThe first 5 podcast episodes and transcripts are already live across the interwebz and on our website, so you can dig right in and start binge-listening today (or on tomorrow's commute).:train:\n\n- Angie, Sukrutha &amp; Gretchen [the team behind Girl Geek X]",

        "text": "It appears we skipped the presidential honeymoon this cycle! Immediately following the unexpected 2016 election outcome and continuing into President Trump\u2019s first 100 days, Silicon Valley and Washington have chaotically attempted to navigate the new paradigm of how politics and tech will interact. The launch of programs like 18F and United States Digital Service (USDS), along with a progressive policy agenda generally embraced in San Francisco and other tech hubs, enabled significant collaboration between the Obama Administration and tech. Will there be opportunities for collaboration between the Trump Administration and tech in 2017 or should we merely prepare for more nasty collisions? If the latter, will the resistance lead to a reversal of progress achieved by 18F, USDS and other modernization efforts that have done so much work to bring the federal government into the 21st century? Can the groundswell of recent grassroots civic engagement among tech professionals be sustainably channeled into effecting positive change for Americans across the country, even in so called Trump states, or will this moment prove to be another instance of over-hyped, fleeting rhetoric?

This is universal and not specific to one person.\nPlease make this a high priority starting today.\nPlease take a few minutes and send brief thank you emails to all the speakers, mentors, informational interviews, tours, job interviews you have had since January, if you haven't already. \nRemember, it is never too late to say Thank You. If you need email addresses, please ping Jade or me.\nEveryone has their \"thing\". Good manners is mine b/c my network is my professional currency.\nIt's your professional reputation (and ours and sometimes mine or other students/staff) that gets dinged when we don't all show outsiders this common curtesy. \nPlease and thank you will build, maintain your network and be the difference one day in having doors open for you, favors extended and jobs offered. It's free, fast and easy. If you need help or templates let me know. I'm happy to help you.  \nI'm saying this to you as a group because you, as female engineers, are held in the public for better or worse to a higher standard with additional attention and interest in seeing you succeed.  I also am extra vested in YOUR success, as you know. Help me help you.  Please PM by EOD with an update on who you sent thank you notes to. Thanks! :blush:",

        "text": "Are you looking for a mentor to\u00a0maximize your potential and realize your career goals?? Do you want to interact with successful women working in tech and non-tech roles in the tech industry? Have you ever attended tech events hoping to meet and learn from women leaders you admire, only to find that approaching them is just TOO awkward? No matter what point you are in your career, do you know that having a mentor can help you flourish, achieve your goals AND experience new meaning in your work? Join us for The Expat Woman's Women in Tech Mentoring event that helps mentees get actual face time with women working in different roles in the tech industry. The mentors participating in this event have both tech and non-tech backgrounds. The evening will start with networking, followed by a short presentation by each mentor. Mentees and mentors will then meet in a fast-paced group setting, asking and answering questions, with the option of making a longer-term connection. We will have mentors from small and big tech companies, representing both technical and non-technical roles. \u00a0 Mentors Tori Main, Motion Designer, Marketing and Creative Team @Lyft Julia Yu, Software Engineer @Lyft Sara Giardina, Litigation Counsel @Lyft Naisha Silva, Analyst @Google Cinzia Borello,\u00a0SMB Program Manager @Facebook Nina Seth, Senior Product Marketing Manager @VMware Eleni Karahalios,\u00a0Learning &amp; Development @Levi's Sanya Mansoor, Cloud Security @Autodesk Emelia Lartey, Account Executive @ Yelp Thank you to our venue sponsors Lyft Terms of Participation Agreement You agree that you are responsible for any accidents or damages that you cause.

        "text": "We talk a lot about the lack of women in technology. What\u2019s keeping them out? The Lady Problem Global Hackathon Series, presented by AngelHack, is launching in a city near you!The Lady Problems Global Hackathon Series is setting out to answer that question. We\u2019re challenging our community of 100,000+ women and men, developers, designers, entrepreneurs to create technology that will address the problems that prevent female entrepreneurship.And course, male allies are welcome too!Why is this an issue?Women represent half of the global population, reinvest 90% of their income into their families and communities, but earn just 10% of the world\u2019s income. Studies have shown that advancing women\u2019s equality can add between $12-28 trillion to global economic growth.According to UN Women, companies with 3 or more women in senior management functions score higher in all dimensions of organizational effectiveness, yet just 4% of Fortune 500 companies are led by women. In startup-land, you\u2019ll find the same results. First Round Capital\u2019s analysis of 300 portfolio companies over ten years showed that startup teams with at least one female founder performed 63% better than all male teams, yet around only 4% of women are backed by VC funding.It\u2019s proven that investing in women creates a better world, and yet they\u2019re not even close to meeting their potential. So what can we do to solve these problems?Hack a solution that will help women access health resources to ensure that they can have successful careers, regardless of whether or not they choose to have children.Hack a solution that ensures that women can be safe when they go to, are at, and come home from work.Hack a solution that helps women gain access to the financial resources, training and support they need to grow their businesses.Hack a solution that helps women succeed and feel confident in the workplace and that they are supported in their careers by their families and communities.Social Good Accelerator: The winning team from each city will be inducted into AngelHack\u2019s first-ever social good accelerator, a 12-week mentorship and acceleration program.Women Who Code: The winning team from each city in an Applaud Her spot in the CODE Review, a featured placement in their global community newsletter.Challenge:Best use of HPE Haven OnDemand in any of the main Lady Problems challenges.Prize:\u00a0The winning team of this challenge will receive the following:Invitation to promote their app/solution and tell the world how they are tackling Lady Problems on the HPE Haven OnDemand blog and LinkedIn group, with promotion via various HPE social media channels.Submitted as candidates for an upcoming press article and could also feature in a video production.All participating teams are also being invited to apply to participate in the HPE Haven Startup Accelerator, with participants benefiting from free/substantially discounted software access to help teams take their solutions to market with fewer technology barriers.One Month is giving away a free 30-day trial to all attendees:Go to:\u00a0<https://onemonth.com/?free_trial_code=LadyProblemsSelect> \"Enroll Now\"Select membership levelAt checkout, receive a 30-day free trialEnjoy!Getty Images API:\u00a0Getty Images encourages the use of diverse imagery in your products!

Leverage their API to pull images for your products here \u00a0and select the \u201cGetty Test\u201d key option.Day 109:00 AM : Doors Open to Attendees / Breakfast of Champions10:30 AM : Opening Ceremony and Sponsor Talks11:30 AM : Team-building and networking session 12:00 PM : Coding Begins01:00 PM : Lunch02:00 PM : Cisco Breakout Session06:30 PM : Dinner07:00 PM : CODE: Debugging the Gender Gap documentary screening, sponsored by Capital OneVenue will be open if you choose to hack overnight.Day 208:00 AM : Breakfast12:00 PM : Lunch01:00 PM : Hackathon Ends / Submissions due on hackathon.io.02:00 PM : Demos Begin / Demos only / No Slide Decks(If your demo doesn\u2019t work, take us through the code of what you did and where you got stuck. It\u2019s about showing what you\u2019ve learned and not about pitching an idea)04:00 PM: Winners are Announced / Prize-a-thon!Schedule subject to awesome changes. Stay Tuned!Not-So-Fresh Code:You are welcome to start working on your hack before the event. You can present pre-existing projects, but they must be relevant to the hackathon challenges. You also must demo live at the hackathon on Sunday in-person, or via Google Hangout.We highly encourage all participants to attend the hackathon in-person, to meet other like-minded hackers and gain valuable insights from our sponsors about building amazing products!Ownership and IP:Teams have full ownership of everything they build at our events and are free to do with it as they wish.Team Size:Teams of up to 5 humans are allowed. You can also add 1 Cyborg, Furby, drone, or Sphero.Submission:Each hackathon has its individual <http://hackathon.io|hackathon.io> page, which projects should be submitted on. Submissions take place after 24 hours of pure hacking.Demo Your Hack:You must demo your hack in order to present. No slide-decks or Powerpoint will be allowed. Two minute presentation and one minute Q&amp;A from Judges, live during the event in-person or via a Google Hangout.Code of Conduct:You must abide by the Code of Conduct. We have a zero-tolerance policy for harassment. If you\u2019re making others feel unsafe in anyway, we\u2019ll kick you out. End of story.Let\u2019s be honest, y\u2019all can do better than Powerpoints. Which is why we rock with live DEMOS only! No exceptions. To win an AngelHack hackathon, you will have to demo your product for at least 30 seconds, but no more than 2 minutes. Don\u2019t worry if your project is still not 100% perfected. Projects will be judged based on the following criteria:Impact: How impactful will this solution be for its target audience? Is it scalable?Creativity: How original is this solution?Design: How well designed is this solution, from front end through to UI/UX?Execution: How well executed is this solution from start to finish?Related to Challenge: Is the solution relevant to the themes of lady problems around supporting female entrepreneurs through health, education, safety and culture?\u00a0 \u00a0Minnie Ingersoll\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Neha Sampat\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Renata George\u00a0 \u00a0 COO at Shift \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 CEO, <http://Built.io|Built.io> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Managing Director,\u00a0 \u00a0Technologies, Inc. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Zenmen Venture Fund\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rekha Pai\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Annika Peterson\u00a0 \u00a0 Member Board of \u00a0 \u00a0Software Engineer,\u00a0 \u00a0Directors at Fast \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cisco Meraki\u00a0Forward, New Business Incubation at Juniper \u00a0 \u00a0 Networks\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mansi ParikhCEO,KindWhale\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cyrus Gil\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Sahil JainAre all genders welcome?
