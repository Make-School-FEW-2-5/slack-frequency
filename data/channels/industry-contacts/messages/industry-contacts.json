I found him by just looking up the company on LinkedIn and looking for someone who I had a mutual connection with (in this case, Braus) and then asking him if he could connect us. After getting the engineer's email from Braus, I wrote him a brief email with a couple of questions and he got back to me the next day. I really encourage everyone to do the same, I kind of just did it on a whim and it only took ten minutes but I'm really glad I did it!"

He let me know about his career trajectory, and was very open about what it took for him to get where he is today. He is super enthusiastic about mentoring Make School students. By the end of our conversation we agreed to stay in touch and meet on a monthly basis. Even though his main languages are JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, he offered to give me code reviews and user testing feedback on any projects I am working on.\n\nSome key takeaways: all of the jobs he has had as a developer, he got because someone he knew recommended him for an interview. Every night after work, he pushed himself to level up. In the beginning, he offered trades (I build your website, for x-product you are selling). As soon as he had a few quality products in his portfolio, he landed his first developer position.\n\nI feel grateful that we got to meet. If you are having trouble getting a mentor that is a good fit for you, don\u2019t be nervous about reaching out and asking for help.",

        "fallback": "[January 30th, 2018 4:12 PM] phyllis: I met with my second mentor last week on Thursday. He is a senior UI engineer at Netflix. We had the BEST conversation. He let me know about his career trajectory, and was very open about what it took for him to get where he is today. He is super enthusiastic about mentoring Make School students. By the end of our conversation we agreed to stay in touch and meet on a monthly basis. Even though his main languages are JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, he offered to give me code reviews and user testing feedback on any projects I am working on.\n\nSome key takeaways: all of the jobs he has had as a developer, he got because someone he knew recommended him for an interview. Every night after work, he pushed himself to level up. In the beginning, he offered trades (I build your website, for x-product you are selling). As soon as he had a few quality products in his portfolio, he landed his first developer position.\n\nI feel grateful that we got to meet. If you are having trouble getting a mentor that is a good fit for you, don\u2019t be nervous about reaching out and asking for help."

She mentioned that it's harder to get a job in tech than it actually is to work in tech, which is something I was really concerned about.\n\nIt took a few emails to reach her, so I'm really glad I followed through even though I was hesitant to do so at first. And, not surprisingly, she emphasized the importance of networking in getting your first job!",

He let me know about his career trajectory, and was very open about what it took for him to get where he is today. He is super enthusiastic about mentoring Make School students. By the end of our conversation we agreed to stay in touch and meet on a monthly basis. Even though his main languages are JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, he offered to give me code reviews and user testing feedback on any projects I am working on.\n\nSome key takeaways: all of the jobs he has had as a developer, he got because someone he knew recommended him for an interview. Every night after work, he pushed himself to level up. In the beginning, he offered trades (I build your website, for x-product you are selling). As soon as he had a few quality products in his portfolio, he landed his first developer position.\n\nI feel grateful that we got to meet. If you are having trouble getting a mentor that is a good fit for you, don\u2019t be nervous about reaching out and asking for help.",

Turns out, having them do something they actually care about about does wonders on morale, productivity, and just general growth. Encouragement on things that don\u2019t seem tried and true also goes a long way. Seems like a given, but hey, you\u2019d be surprised. \n\nAnother used to be a mobile instructor for Make School and is now working at Coursera as a front-end dev. Things don\u2019t always go the way you expect, but sometimes it can lead to something you wouldn\u2019t expect to enjoy. Something to take to heart, really.\n\nIntimidating at first to call professionals, but they\u2019re typically pretty chill. Just have at it and remember they were in the same spot we were before.",

Some good take-aways: \n\nThe work doesn\u2019t stop when you sell out to a corporate giant like Pandora, Facebook, Apple, or Google. That opens up a world of possibilities and may be the beginning, not the end, of your career in software.\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to learn the culture of those who are around you. You and your team can only benefit by seeking out perspectives on how workplace solutions and your communication may affect others. \n\nBe relentless about what you want, and go get it. There are no half measures.\n\nRemember to reach out to your mentors and have a genuine conversation with them. It will definitely keep you motivated to be great.",

We had a great discussion about EdTech, and the state of education in general. By the end of the discussion she mentioned a colleague at her company that she thought I should meet. She came to the open house, and to my knowledge is still interested in getting mentees. \n\nToday I reached out to another mentor, and he emailed me back immediately. We scheduled a meeting for next week. Moral of the story, keep trying until you find a mentor that works for you!",

Ultimately, you\u2019re meeting a stranger who you know a little bit about and whom you know wants to meet you and help you in your career path. Start by researching them via LI. You may find commonalities (cities, people in common, companies you know etc.). Start the conversation by thanking them for their time to meet with you to learn more about their career path and the work they are doing today. \nTell them about what your studying, what you\u2019re building, places you think you might want to get an internship of industries and roles in general you\u2019re interested in. Ask them if they have guidance for things they would suggest you focus on to get there. If they are technical, ask them if they\u2019d be open to a quick code review/feedback session\u2026I bet if will all be a very natural conversation. In person is ideal, if you can make that happen on your end.",

        "author_name": "Ingrid Lunden", 
        "title_link": "https://www.google.com/amp/s/techcrunch.com/2017/11/15/linkedin-rolls-out-its-career-advice-mentoring-program-to-us-uk-and-india/amp/", 
        "service_url": "http://techcrunch.com", 
        "text": "LinkedIn, the Microsoft-owned social platform for the working world with some 530 million members, has made a big push in the last couple of years to position itself not just as a place to look for new jobs and network, but as a place for professional development &mdash; including services for&nbsp;online learning; steady streams of&nbsp;news and other content to expand your knowledge; and most recently help with building your resume. Today, it&rsquo;s taking the wraps off the latest product in that effort: users in the US, UK and India will now be able to use LinkedIn to connect with mentors to help coach them on how to steer themselves in their careers, free of charge.\nCareer Advice, as the new product is called, is the full roll out of an online mentoring service that LinkedIn launched in a limited format this past summer, in San Francisco and Australia. The idea is to connect users with mentors who can help them figure out anything to do with their career, whether it&rsquo;s ideas on how to find a new job, feedback for why they are not getting ahead or feeling satisfied at work, and maybe even to pivot to a new career altogether.\nIf you are in the three countries in the first wave of the rollout, to start using the service, you can click on this link, or go to your own LinkedIn Profile and look for the Career Advice tab on your dashboard (which sits about halfway down the page and in my opinion is not immediately easy to find).\nYou then go through a short script of questions to set out what it is that you are looking for &mdash; for example, in terms of goals, or whether you want someone in your geography or from your alma mater &mdash; and then you start to get recommendations of people who might fit the bill, who are presented to you in a series of Tinder-style swiping screens for you to choose as a potential match.\n\n    \n\t\t            \n\t\t            Dashboard\n\t\t            \n\t\t            \n\t\t        \n\t\t            \n\t\t            Expanded Card\n\t\t            \n\t\t            \n\t\t        \n\t\t            \n\t\t            Hub\n\t\t            \n\t\t            \n\t\t        \n\t\t            \n\t\t            Preference\n\t\t            \n\t\t            \n\t\t        \n\t        &nbsp;View Slideshow\n\t    \n\t    \n\t        Previous\n\t        Next\n\t        Exit\n\t    \n\t\nOn the mentor side, LinkedIn also asks them to indicate their preferences for what kind of mentoring they would like to provide. For the limited release of Career Advice, LinkedIn has been proactively selecting mentors, although the longer-term plan is to make mentoring an option to anyone on the platform,&nbsp;Hari Srinivasan, head of identity products, told me during the test run.\nOnce you and a mentor match, you can then message each other, and either side can terminate the communication at any point.\nFor LinkedIn, launching this product is important for a few reasons.\nFirst and foremost, it is filling a gap in the wider world of career development online. Today, job hunting has almost completely gone digital, as have many other aspects of our professional careers. While some people and workplaces are very proactive in developing mentoring relationships &lsquo;in real life&rsquo; for the vast majority of us, this doesn&rsquo;t exist.\nAnd ironically, we&rsquo;re probably now at a point as a working society where mentoring and getting advice on how to steer your career needs to exist more than ever before. The idea of a career for life, let alone a job for life, is not the norm for many people in developed economies, due in part to the pace of technological development, and in part to other economic factors like globalization.\nLinkedIn&rsquo;s own survey of 6,000 people aged 25-33 found the majority of them have faced a &ldquo;quarter-life&rdquo; crisis, and job anxiety is the number-one reason for this, with 61 percent putting this at the top of their list above financial or social woes. This is what LinkedIn believes it can address with its online mentoring service.\nOn a pure business level, the mentoring service is also a key development for LinkedIn in its wider strategy as a social network. When the company was still independent, its user growth had been slowing down in its mature markets.\nThe company has, of course, been ramping up its efforts to expand in developing countries (including &mdash; at long last &mdash; the launch of a pared-down Android app), but to grow in another way, it&rsquo;s been tinkering with many more ways to improve engagement with the users it already has. LinkedIn, at its core, still feels like the kind of platform that most people only use when they have to &mdash; that is, when they may be changing jobs. And this is another way of trying to get those users to come to LinkedIn because they want to.\nLast but not least, the third reason LinkedIn needs to start getting a little more creative with its services is because its competition is not sitting still. Google just today updated its own job listings search. And it&rsquo;s not the only one. We reported earlier this year that Facebook, which has been doing a lot more with job ads, also seems to be looking at ways of matching up mentors with those in need of career guidance.\nWith the Facebook network much more geared at people conversing with each other, and already successfully luring people in to look at their Timelines on a regular basis &mdash; it now has over 2 billion monthly active users, and nearly 1.4 billion daily active users &mdash; LinkedIn needs to lock down its place here, before someone else takes on the role for them.",
