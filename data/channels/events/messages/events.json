There's no better way to spend your Earth Day than by learning about the issues facing our environment! Last year, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned us that limiting a drastic temperature increase to our atmosphere would require rapid, far-reaching, and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society. Simultaneously, our ocean is being threatened by plastic pollution is flooding our waterways, corals are bleaching at abnormal rates, and criminal activities at sea remain rampant. We require a fundamental and immediate transformation within our governing systems, businesses, and civil society if we, as the last generation capable of making significant strides in protecting our environment, are to rise to this challenge. Join us for a conversation on the health and future of our ocean with Nishan Degnarain, economist and founder of Breakthrough Ocean Ventures. Agenda Networking: 6:00 pm - 6:30 pm Panel: 6:30 pm - 7:15 pm Audience Q&amp;A: 7:15 pm - 7:30 pm Networking: 7:30 pm onwards Nishan's Bio Degrees in Economics, Cambridge University and Harvard Kennedy School of Government.

Moldover and Dani will teach you how to solder, plus Mitchell and I\u2019ll also be present to help you improve your soldering technique.\n\n*IMPORTANT:* We have enough soldering stations and materials for 30 students (15 pairs) but may not be able to accommodate more than that. React :star-struck: you\u2019re *totally psyched and definitely coming* or :slightly_smiling_face: if you\u2019re *interested and maybe coming* so I can anticipate how many people will show up tonight and set up the room and materials. React :calendar: if you\u2019re *interested but can\u2019t make it tonight* and want to participate in a potential future workshop.\n\nParticipation is free, but the DIY Voice Crusher hardware kit costs $40 (I got Moldover to give us a discount) as it contains a printed circuit board and 38 electrical components. If you really want to participate but can\u2019t afford it, *DM me before 7pm*, as I also got Make School to offer a limited number of *scholarships* (first come, first served).\n\n:seedling::brain: Come with a beginner\u2019s mind, ready to take your first step into the wonderful world of hardware hacking!",

Even if you\u2019ve never soldered before, this workshop will give you the confidence in just a short time. If you do have experience, you\u2019ll learn how to solder better. <@UC36F4P2M> and I will be there to assist with soldering. Every participant will walk away with a fun and unique instrument that is also a collectible copy of \u201cFour Track\u201d.\n\n<@UCDAE5GSJ> and <@UCFCGA3C1> joined me for this at Noisebridge last December and we had a ton of fun! :smile:\n\n\u2022 Learn about the DIY Voice Crusher kit: <https://moldover.com/do-it-yourself-kit-for-the-voice-crusher/>\n\u2022 Facebook event with all the logistical details: <https://www.facebook.com/events/275678970032232/>\n\n<@U28S64ZJ5> <@UCC0KLBPU> <@U6YCJRXGF> <@UCBDPE94Z> <@UCBKC02JY> @anyonewholikeselectronicsandmusic",

        "text": "The rise of edge computing is reshaping the way we think of the internet. As data and content generation become increasingly decentralized, so too must the supporting networks and cloud infrastructure. The disruptive potential of the edge is further driven by the arrival of 5G, the proliferation of connected devices, and the heavy, real-time computing requirements of emerging applications. Yet the industry has only just begun to scratch the surface of the true value that edge computing can deliver. Designing applications for this new computing paradigm will require close collaboration across technology ecosystems, a practice that has always been foundational to our work at the Foundry. The AT&amp;T Foundry Edge Computing Zone (EC Zone) program unites the technology ecosystem to develop generation-defining applications for the 5G network edge. Designing the Edge consists of three\u00a0separate segments: Futurecast, Symposium (Invitation Only), and Participant Talks. The event will feature demonstrations and discussions on the evolution of infrastructure and our three core missions: Cutting the Cord on XR and Gaming Real Time IoT Analytics: Alert and Response Live HD-3D Mapping for Vehicle Automation Designing the Edge\u00a0Demo and Speaker Participants ARM,\u00a0Arvizio,\u00a0City of San Jose,\u00a0Civil Maps,\u00a0<http://Foresight.ai|Foresight.ai>,\u00a0Genetec,\u00a0HP Enterprise, HERE Technologies,\u00a0HTC VIVE, Microsoft,\u00a0MobiledgeX,\u00a0NGCodec,\u00a0NVIDIA VR,\u00a0Gridraster,\u00a0<http://Packet.io|Packet.io>,\u00a0Playgiga,\u00a0Qualcomm, Rafay Systems, <http://Swim.ai|Swim.ai>, <http://Vapor.io|Vapor.io>, Vintra &amp; more March 25 (5\u20138 p.m.): Futurecast - \"Rise of the Edge\" This discussion introduces the concept of edge computing and its applicability\u00a0to 5G.

        "text": "Do you want to become an Ethereum Blockchain developer in 2019? The best way to get started is to dive in the ERC721 token standard. \"ERC-721 is a free, open standard that describes how to build non-fungible or unique tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. While most tokens are fungible (every token is the same as every other token), ERC-721 tokens are all unique.\u00a0Think of them like rare, one-of-a-kind collectables.\" <http://erc721.org/> In this workshop, we will explore what the core differences between ERC20 and ERC721 are.\u00a0 We will get a chance to work hands-on with professional standard software to craft smart contracts. Here's a short list of the tools we'll be using during the workshop. 1. The Remix Browser <https://remix.ethereum.org> 2. Truffle Framework <https://truffleframework.com/> 3. The Solidity Programming Language <https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.2/> We'll have fun building the ERC721 smart contract from the ground up using the\u00a0official EIP as a guide. In the end, we will acquire\u00a0valuable skills\u00a0in learning to decipher\u00a0 EIPs. <https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-721.md> You will leave with production quality code to use as a base for your next crypto project. Tentative Schedule 9:00am to 1:00pm (4hrs) About the Instructor: Fod\u00e9 Diop is a Computer Science student at\u00a0 Make School. He's one of the few people in San Francisco with production experience in the fields of Ethereum Smart Contracts. He was part of the winning team of Dora Hack's first US Blockchain and AI hackathon. He was the winner of Facebook DevCircles Oakland Bot Hackathon where he and his teammate\u00a0built a Facebook Messenger bot which can teach a non-native English speaker Computer Science terms. He's also one of the leading instructors in the blockchain\u00a0education space in Silicon\u00a0Valley. He's passionate about education and how to leverage blockchain as a way to teach computer science as well. He co-founded the Oakland Blockchain Developers Meetup group.

        "text": "WHAT IT'S ABOUT How can mental health professionals raise awareness about critical issues, increase access to care or improve treatment? These are a few of the problems likely to be addressed this weekend at \u00a0United Nations SUstainable Development goal Hackathon To\u00a0Fight Depression\u00a0 Depression and a lack of mental health has become one of the most serious and costly issues of our time, especially for young people. We - Coltan,\u00a0Rotary, hospital, City of Berkeley\u00a0have got together in the hope that we can collaborate and change this. WHO WILL BE THERE This inclusive hack brings together some major players in the tech and healthcare sectors. Attendees will come from a mix of disciplines like psychology, healthcare, biology, software, data, AI, UX, strategy, video, art, pharmacology and games design. Organisations represented will include universities and colleges as well as a host of other agencies and organisations. HOW WILL WE DO IT Participants\u00a0will\u00a0collaborate, explore and co-create prototype solutions to help people with depression and those close to them, i.e. friends and family.\u00a0Participants\u00a0will be fully briefed before the event. Participants will be grouped into teams, each of which will identify a problem that needs to be solved in the field of mental health, devise a solution and build a prototype. There's a $600 prize for the best proposal focusing on underserved populations. As an example of a potential proposal, a team might pitch an app aimed at people suffering from depression designed to reduce feelings of isolation by increasing their connections to others. Coding skills or prior experience in hackathons are not needed to participate. We encourage teams to form with a wide variety of backgrounds and skills. WHERE AND WHEN \u00a0January 12 2019 The participants will present their \"pain points\" \u2013 issues that need to be addressed \u2013 form teams, and brainstorm how to address those issues. Saturday\u2019s event is open to the public and will begin in the morning and end in the evening with an award ceremony. All this action will take place\u00a0on the 12th January Food and drinks (and some very special entertainment!) will also be provided. All in all it's a great opportunity to make a difference on a very significant issue, meet some very talented people, extend your network, get some great credentials, learn a lot, share and be part of a story that says you helped something with serious purpose happen!

        "text": "On Nov 14, join ~180 devs at SF Python&amp;#39;s presentation night and learn more about how you can use Python to find faults in the Earth, build machine learning infrastructure, and more! If you&amp;#39;d like to present a 5 mins Lightning talk or a 10-15 mins Short Talk at future meetups, please submit your talk ideas here. Our generous sponsor Yelp will also provide pizza and drinks for this evening. PROGRAM Lightning talks Where&amp;#39;s All the Development? a simple, instructive, take on a git-like VCS, Edmund Huber Why we choose Python/Flask to power some of the largest retailers in the world, Morgan Linton Short talk(~10 mins + Q&amp;A) Finding faults with Python, Rob Sare Speaker Bio Rob Sare is an Earth observation and Python enthusiast who enjoys working on impactful problems involving spatial and environmental data. He is pursuing a Ph.D. at Stanford, where he uses image processing and numerical modelling techniques to investigate landscapes affected by earthquakes and other tectonic activity at regional and global scales. In his free time, he is an avid cyclist and enjoys contributing to open source projects, and has recently developed tools for classification of rivers in satellite imagery and real-time gas sensor data analysis during internships at Los Alamos National Lab and the U.S. Geological Survey. Abstract Most people living in the Bay Area have felt an earthquake and the instrumental record gives us a real-time view of seismic activity today. However, even in areas with sparse historic data, the landscape can give us important clues to how mature or active a fault zone might be in the form of fault scarps and other earthquake-related landforms like those in the famous Olema Valley south of Point Reyes. This talk is about scarplet, a Python image processing package for detecting and measuring key attributes of these and other landforms in topographic data. Main talk (~25 mins + Q&amp;A) LyftLearn - Machine Learning Infrastructure at Lyft, Narek Amirbekian Speaker Bio Narek is a software engineer on the Machine Learning Platform team at Lyft. Previously, he&amp;#39;s worked at a number of data centric roles at Zendesk, 4INFO, Edmodo, and Aarki. In his spare time he enjoys biking and brewing hoppy beers. Abstract Lyft has hundreds of machine learning models running at any given time. In the past every team had to build custom infrastructure for prototyping, training, and deploying models. Lyft learn gives data scientists and engineers at Lyft a shared environment to do all of these thing. Our tech stack is built on python flask and kubernetes. AGENDA 6:00p - Check-in and mingle, with food provided by our generous sponsor! 7:05p - Welcome 7:30p - Door close 7:10p - Announcements, lightning talks and main talk 8:15p - More mingling 9:30p - Hard stop SF Python is run by volunteers aiming to foster the Python community in the Bay Area. Please consider making a donation to SF Python and saying a big thank you to Yelp for providing pizza, beer, and the venue for this Wednesday&amp;#39;s meetup. Yelp sees 89 million mobile users and 79 million desktop users every month. Keeping everything running smoothly requires the best and brightest in the industry. Their engineers come from diverse technical backgrounds and value digital craftsmanship, open-source, and creative problem-solving. They write tests, review code, and push multiple times a day. Come out and talk to them.",

But in communities of color, humility and hard work are thought to be virtues that lead to success. We want to explore the relationship around advocating for yourself while being true to who you are.\u00a0Join us for an evening with some notable Slack personalities, Robby Kwok (VP of People), Arquay Harris (Director of Engineering), and Helen Kupp (Strategy &amp; Analytics Lead). We\u2019ll explore what it means to thrive as a person of color in tech and how to best advocate for yourself everyday. \u00a0There will be dinner, drinks, gifts, and lively conversation.\u00a0Above all, we hope that it will be a fun and productive night with your fellow Earthtones from companies across the valley.",

At venues with multiple stages, festival-goers are always looking to identify DJ stage areas with the liveliest atmosphere. This causes them to constantly move around between different stages and miss out on having fun. You are looking to use Machine Learning and IoT technologies to solve this unique <http://problem.Do|problem.Do> you accept the Challenge?The objective of this task is to help the festival-goers quickly identify the DJ stage where crowd is the happiest. You've seen a lot of buzz around computer vision, machine learning, and IoT and want to use this technology to detect crowd emotions. From your initial research there are existing ML models that you can leverage to do face and emotion detection, but there are two ways that the predictions (inference) can be done; on the cloud and on the camera itself, but which one will work the best for your needs at the festival? You are going to test both approaches and find out!In this workshop you will use AWS and Intel technologies to learn how to build, deploy, and run ML inference on the cloud as well as on the IoT Edge. You will learn to use Amazon SageMaker with Intel C5 Instances, AWS DeepLens, AWS Greengrass, Amazon Rekognition, and AWS Lambda to build an end-to-end IoT solution that performs machine learning.",

The adventure coincides with a celestial event that will be visible only at the end site. Space-themed costumes are recommended! This will be the twelfth edition of Journey to the End of the Night in San Francisco. We invite you and your friends to take over the city streets in the name of play, dash down hidden alleys, encounter astrological strangers, and change how you experience the city! Journey to the End of the Night is a free street game played across cities around the world. Players sporting colored ribbons will run through a series of checkpoints scattered throughout the city, while avoiding being caught by chasers. For one night, drop your relations, your work and leisure activities, and all your usual motives for movement and action, and let yourself be drawn by the attractions of the chase and the encounters you find there. No public transit, no bicycles, no skates, no cars, no taxis. You may only travel on foot, so wear comfortable shoes and bring water. Online pre-registration through Eventbrite is required. We will start handing out materials at 5pm at UN Plaza, and the game begins at 6pm. You must be there before the game starts to be able to play! As always, Journey is free to play, but donations are highly appreciated to help us cover material costs.",

It\u2019s an urban foot race where you explore checkpoints with activities around SF while running away from chasers until you get caught, then you start chasing other runners and catch them! (Think zombies versus humans, but without the zombie theme.) It starts at 5pm very close to Vantaggio. You\u2019ll gain a greater appreciation for SF by playing this. It\u2019s really fun!

In this talk, Diego will explore the technical aspects of content curation using flexible UI architectures.\u00a0\u00a0 Talk # 2:\u00a0Yelp\u2019s Journey to Kotlin By: Gesh Markov\u00a0 In this talk Gesh will walk you through his experience with Kotlin -- from his initial introduction at Google IO 2017 to the process of making it one of the two primary languages used in Yelp\u2019s production Android apps. You will get a glimpse into Yelp\u2019s engineering culture, how we evaluate complex transitions and how we go about change management that affect the daily jobs of our entire Android engineering community. He will highlight some of the team\u2019s challenges and concerns and how we mitigated or dispelled them. Agenda 6:00 PM: Check-in, Food + Networking7:00 PM - Introductions7:05 PM: Talk #1\u00a07:15 PM: Doors Close (note: we will no longer be letting anyone into the building after this time)7:40 PM: Talk #2\u00a08:15 PM: Networking + Close9:00 PM: Event Ends Speaker Bios: Diego Waxemberg Diego is a member of Yelp\u2019s Reader Experience team focusing on providing users with the highest quality, most engaging content. His recent endeavors include a complete rewrite of the business page and a novel framework for building dynamic screens. As a senior member of Yelp\u2019s Android community, Diego has mentored several engineers and is always looking for ways to improve development practices. When he\u2019s not recycling views, Diego spends time on his personal project, Moonlight, and enjoys wine tasting, backpacking, and playing soccer. Gesh Markov Gesh wrote his first few dozen of programs at the age of ten in BASIC on an 8-bit Pravetz 8C before running out of space on his 160 KB 5.25\u201d floppy disk and discovering his second life-long passion - computer games. Since finishing his BSc he\u2019s focused his career on mobile from the dark days of J2ME on to Android and iOS since the very first versions of both platforms. Gesh has worked for himself, a start-up he co-founded, a few agencies and most recently Google and Yelp. He has been described as a \u201cfountain of knowledge\u201d and a \u201cthoughtful challenger of the status quo\u201d. He loves learning new things and believes he can learn something from everyone.",

Humanity is becoming interplanetary. Recent space science missions to Pluto and Jupiter, the discovery of thousands of exoplanets, and orbital missions to monitor Spaceship Earth offer lessons on how we will get to the Red Planet. Space agencies, academia and industry are working right now on the missions that will get \u201cboots on Mars\u201d in the 2030s. We are testing advanced technologies for the next giant leaps of exploration. From solar electric propulsion to cutting-edge life support systems, to the first crops grown in space, the journey to Mars is already unfolding in tangible ways. This month\u2019s panel will review a three-stage plan \u2013 from missions close to Earth involving commercial partners and the International Space Station, advancing to missions in Earth\u2013Moon orbit, or deep space, and finally moving on to Mars, where explorers will be practically independent from spaceship Earth. The innovation required to for humanity to become interplanetary cuts across science, exploration and technology. The panelists will discuss the search for life, past and present, on Mars and research in analog environments on Earth. Fundamentally, education, knowledge and access are the keys to exploring our solar system, Spaceship Earth, and ourselves. The presentation will conclude with an inclusive message on STEAMD (science-technology-engineering-arts-math-design) about changing the conversation to include everyone: the artists, designers, poets and makers. We are all astronauts on Spaceship Earth! Eleanor Roosevelt once said that the \u201cfuture belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.\u201d Dava Newman is the Apollo Professor of Astronautics and Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, MA. She previously served as Deputy Administrator of NASA under the Obama administration, from May 2015 until January 2017. Dava\u2019s research has included space flight experiments, ground-based simulations and mathematical modeling. Some of her recent projects have focused on space suit design, dynamics and control of astronaut motion, mission analysis and engineering systems design, and policy analysis. Dava is perhaps best known for her work on the \u201cBio-Suit,\u201d a space activity suit that provides pressure by tension in the suit\u2019s textile weave instead of with pressurized gas, resulting in greater comfort and ease of movement for astronauts wearing the suit. She has published extensively and holds a Ph.D. in aerospace biomedical engineering from MIT, M.S. degrees in aerospace engineering and technology and policy from MIT, and a B.S. in aerospace engineering from the University of Notre Dame. Nathalie Cabrol\u00a0is an astrobiologist and the Director of SETI Institute Carl Sagan Center for Research where she spearheads a new multidisciplinary roadmap to bridge astrobiology and SETI. She has a background in planetary and environmental sciences, and astrobiology. Her research focuses on the exploration of habitability and life beyond Earth. She counts over 470 peer-reviewed publications and proceedings of professional conferences, and is the author of three books and 10 chapters of books on the subject of planetary science and exploration, astrobiology, and terrestrial extreme environments. Nathalie is the recipient of NASA and other research awards. She is a Carey Fellow (Wings Worldquest Women of Discovery - Air and Space, 2007), and a Fellow of the California Academy of Sciences since 2016. She was honored to present the Sagan Lecture at AGU in December 2016. Dr. Jennifer Heldmann is currently a research scientist in the Division of Space Sciences and Astrobiology at NASA Ames Research Center. She also supports NASA Headquarters as a Program Officer within the Planetary Science Division. She has a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Astrogeophysics from Colgate University, a Master\u2019s degree in Space Studies with a Minor in Geology, and a Ph.D. in Planetary Science from the University of Colorado at Boulder. Heldmann\u2019s scientific research interests focus on studies of the Moon and Mars. Her Mars research focuses on studies of recent water on the Red Planet through spacecraft data analysis, numerical modeling, and fieldwork in Mars-analog environments such as the Outback of Australia, the Canadian High Arctic, the Atacama Desert, Spitsbergen, the Mojave Desert, Iceland, US Southwest, and Antarctica. Water is especially important to understand climate, geology, and the potential for past and/or present life on Mars. She is also involved in planning for the future human exploration of Mars and has served on several MEPAG (Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group) special action teams for defining precursor activities needed to enable future human exploration of Mars. Heldmann has written numerous scientific papers and book chapters and is the recipient of multiple NASA Achievement Awards including a NASA Headquarters Special Act Award, NASA Ames Honor Award, multiple NASA Group Achievement Awards and the NASA Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal (2015). She was inducted into the U.S. Space Camp Hall of Fame in 2017. She is committed to education and public outreach and is keen to inspire the next generation of scientists and explorers by sharing the excitement of Solar System exploration with students, teachers, and the general public whenever possible.

A lot of their companies are grounded in groundbreaking biotech projects that could definitely use the support of some ninja developers like us.\n\nIf that sounds cool, here's some cool events they're hosting in the near future, nearby to our location and totally free of charge. First is called _Cellular Agriculture and the Future of Biomanufacturing_ (<https://www.eventbrite.com/e/cellular-agriculture-and-the-future-of-biomanufacturing-tickets-49460345224>) in a week; second's called _Regenerating the Body with Stem Cell Therapies_ (<https://www.eventbrite.com/e/regenerating-the-body-with-stem-cell-therapies-tickets-49487689010>).\n\nHoping to see some of y'all there! :nerd_face: :fire: :female-scientist::skin-tone-5: :microscope: :male-doctor::skin-tone-5:",

        "text": "FYI: RSVP-ING WILL NOT GUARANTEE\u00a0ENTRY TO THE EVENT. YOU MUST FILL OUT THE SUBMISSION FORM TO COMPLETE YOUR REGISTRATION \u00a0 The QBI hackathon is a 48-hour event connecting the vibrant Bay Area developer community with the scientists from UCSF, during which we work together on the cutting edge biomedical problems. Recent advances in computer vision, AI, and machine learning have enabled computers to pick out cat videos, recognize people\u2019s faces from photos, play video games and drive cars. We look forward\u00a0to seeing how far we can push science ahead when we apply these latest algorithms to biomedically relevant light microscopy, electron microscopy, and proteomics data. If you love FFTs, convolutional neural nets, topological data processing, or simply\u00a0writing code, this is your chance to apply your skills to make an impact on global healthcare. Beyond the actual event, we hope to establish a better connection between talented developers and scientists in the Bay Area, so that we can work together and learn from each other. Prior to the hackathon, we will host a meet and greet mixer on October 4th at Oda Restaurant and Brewery in Mission Bay, San Francisco. This will give an opportunity for attendees to meet each other, form groups and start thinking about their projects in advance of the actual hackathon.\u00a0 We STRONGLY suggest attending the meet and greet mixer to give yourself ample time to deliver your product. The exact location will be revealed in the mixer. \u00a0 COMPLETE YOUR REGISTRATION NOW!",

We'll have many games on display for gamedevs to show off their creations in person. Sip specialty indie themed cocktails while grooving to DJ-blended retro tunes. 21+ only! Have a game to share? We'll have some open tables where you can bring a laptop and show it off! Get ready to meet people, play games, and kick GDC off indie-style! FAQs Does this event cost anything to attend? Nope! It's a free event but you must be 21 or older to enter. Do I have to be a developer to attend? No way! Everyone is welcome. We'll have lots of games, so come play them! How far away is the venue from the convention? Just a 7 min walk! How long can I demo my game? About an hour. We want to make sure other folks also get a chance to show off their game. What if my game isn't finished? That's totally fine. Show us what you're working on. What do I need to do to set up my game at the event? Find an open table and it's yours! Since space is limited, please don't bring large equipment such as monitors/tvs. Bring your fully charged laptop and/or tablet. Do I have to bring my printed ticket to the event? Tickets are not required to attend the event, the RSVPs give us an idea of how many people to expect. Your ticket does not guarantee entry - if we hit capacity, it'll be a one-in, one-out situation. How can I contact the organizer with any questions? You can email us at contact (at) <http://gamejolt.com|gamejolt.com>",

We are running volunteer workshops, called Datathons, with the goal of vetting the accuracy and quality of the data.\u00a0 During this Datathon, you'll work side-by-side with Community Representatives -- people who are currently or have previously been homeless -- to verify information and make sure the 500+ services in our system are correct. This is a great way to learn about some of the struggles faced by people experiencing homelessness and have an immediate impact in helping them. Snacks and beverages will be provided for volunteers :-) Choose a date and join us! 1:00-1:30pm Volunteer Training1:30-4:00pm Data vetting &amp; discussions **No special skills required, just basic internet browsing and typing** **Please ensure your eventbrite account is connected to your active email account, as we will be sending confirmation details via email*",

Fortune 500 consumer brands, financial institutions and manufacturers alike are pivoting away from simply being a \u2018company\u2019 to being a \u2018software/technology company\u2019. Coding and engineering innovation is no longer only for Silicon Valley \u2013 every corporation in the world is joining the \u201cindustrial revolution\" of code. The more software and the cloud integrate with consumer goods, transportation, hardware, etc \u2013 the more we will see innovation move from manufacturing to coding \u2013 no matter the industry\u00a0\u2013 underscoring the power of developers in 2018 and beyond.

The event will kick off with a reception from 6 - 7pm, with a discussion from 7 - 8pm. We hope that you will stick around afterwards for food and drinks until 9pm! Panelists will include:\u00a0Gene Kimmelman\u00a0(President, Public Knowledge),\u00a0Evan Engstrom\u00a0(Executive Director, Engine),\u00a0Otessa Marie Ghadar\u00a0(Professor, Director of DC Web Fest, Digital Content Creator &amp; Advocate),\u00a0Ernesto Falcon\u00a0(Legislative Counsel, Electronic Frontier Foundation), and\u00a0Brandi Collins\u00a0(Senior Campaign Director; Media, Democracy, &amp; Economic Justice, Color of Change).\u00a0 Public Knowledge has spent nearly ten years fighting for an open internet, but we expect that at the Federal Communications Commission's\u00a0December 14th\u00a0meeting\u00a0a majority of Commissioners will vote to eliminate our strong net neutrality rules. The current FCC has made dominant industry interests a priority, putting startup and consumer\u00a0interests at risk.\u00a0As one of\u00a0the world's largest centers for businesses and individuals financing, creating, and building the technology and inputs to the digital economy,\u00a0Silicon Valley will be directly impacted by these new\u00a0policies. At the same time, AT&amp;T is seeking to merge with Time Warner, and Sinclair Broadcasting with the Tribune Company -- potentially undermining video and broadband competition as net neutrality rules disappear. Public Knowledge is coming to California to discuss these important political shifts with engaged individuals, and to build new connections with individuals who want to learn more about standing up for an open internet.\u00a0The event will encourage audience participation, and we hope you will join us with questions.",

        "text": "We've got two speakers coming from opposite ends of the spectrum, both dedicated to innovative approaches to hacking performance and wellbeing. David Lowenfels is an MIT/Stanford hacker who has innovated a new approach to Heartrate Variablity (HRV) Feedback, and Dr. Gordon Greene - a Zen Priest, and med school professor - who will be presenting his vision for the upgrading of ancient zen practice with modern tech.\u00a0 David Lowenfels, founder of Pranawave, holds degrees in Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, and Music from MIT and Stanford. With 20 years of experience in the healing arts, David now spends his time creating wellness products that combine his passions for technology and healing. David will speak on \u201cHacking the HRV Circuit for Mind-Body Resilience\u201d and demo his Pranawave Biofeedback which trains a state of focused calm and flow through resonance breathing. HRV is a biomarker for stress,wellness and disease. &gt;20 years of clinical research shows that HRV-BF can benefit depression, anxiety, PTSD, cardiac problems, hypertension, and a myriad of other polyvagal pathologies. Gordon Greene, PhD., clinical professor of family medicine at University of Wisconsin and head priest at Spring Green Zen Dojo, and night chaplain at Mereter Hospital, finds delight in\u00a0working with a chain saw in the woods, teaching Rhodes\u00a0Scholars at Oxford University, presenting grand rounds at Harvard Medical School, and\u00a0teaching pre-med students at Williams College to face suffering.\u00a0 Gordon will lead us in a very unique exploration of how this ancient practice might evolve through a merging or augmenting with modern technology. He wont' be presenting any answers or novel technogies, but rather the perspective from teh Zen side of where the entry points would be for innovation. This is a special opportunity, as we don't hear many traditional practitioners open minded and eager to see their contemplative traditions taken through another iteration. Schedule: 6:30:\u00a0Check in, snacks 6:45:\u00a0Structured schmoozing 6:55:\u00a0Event intro and meditation 7:00: David Lowenfels 7:25: Gordon Greene 7:50:\u00a0Break 8:00:\u00a0Break-out Sessions (small group discussion) 9:00:\u00a0Break-out Recap 9:15:\u00a0Closing meditation WANT FREE ADMISSION?

Create a discussion environment between software engineers and social change agents and demystify apps for social benefit. \u00a0 Our goal is to create tools and apps that make the world a better place. OUR HOPE:\u00a0 We hope to demystify conversations around civic and open data to nonprofits and help them realize that their ideas can contribute to apps for social and civic benefit. It should be an inspiring, fun, and informative conversation that will influence community-relevant tool development. You will meet and learn from tech developers, nonprofits, influencers, product designers, and civic leaders who will offer guidance and feedback \u00a0\u00a0------------------------------------------- NONPROFITS:\u00a0 If you\u2019ve found yourself wondering if your org needs a mobile app, we\u2019ll show you examples of apps for social benefit that are already in use. You\u2019ll have an opportunity to share your organization\u2019s real-world problems with the people who may be able to translate those challenges into tools that support your work. We\u2019d love to help you get to the next level and build apps for your nonprofit cause.\u00a0 What we ask of you: Come with ideas for how technology can be implemented Bring anyone on your team in charge of implementing technology Be ready to brainstorm ideas with developers \u00a0\u00a0------------------------------------------- HACKERS &amp; DEVELOPERS: Have you created an app or functional prototype for social benefit?

List of Demos Participants to Come See demos\u00a0of social benefit apps where we plan to: Give developers a place to share their prototypes and apps with the subject matter experts who can provide useful feedback from direct experiences in the sector.\u00a0 Nonprofits get a chance to see what kind of apps for social change are being created and what is possible. Get ideas from nonprofits and issue advocates, and turn those ideas into an actionable format so developers could build on them\u00a0and eventually turn those ideas into apps. Create a discussion environment between software engineers and social change agents and demystify apps for social benefit. \u00a0 Our goal is to create tools and apps that make the world a better place. OUR HOPE:\u00a0 We hope to demystify conversations around civic and open data to nonprofits and help them realize that their ideas can contribute to apps for social and civic benefit. It should be an inspiring, fun, and informative conversation that will influence community-relevant tool development. You will meet and learn from tech developers, nonprofits, influencers, product designers, and civic leaders who will offer guidance and feedback \u00a0\u00a0------------------------------------------- NONPROFITS:\u00a0 If you\u2019ve found yourself wondering if your org needs a mobile app, we\u2019ll show you examples of apps for social benefit that are already in use. You\u2019ll have an opportunity to share your organization\u2019s real-world problems with the people who may be able to translate those challenges into tools that support your work. We\u2019d love to help you get to the next level and build apps for your nonprofit cause.\u00a0 What we ask of you: Come with ideas for how technology can be implemented Bring anyone on your team in charge of implementing technology Be ready to brainstorm ideas with developers \u00a0\u00a0------------------------------------------- HACKERS &amp; DEVELOPERS: Have you created an app or functional prototype for social benefit?

        "text": "It appears we skipped the presidential honeymoon this cycle! Immediately following the unexpected 2016 election outcome and continuing into President Trump\u2019s first 100 days, Silicon Valley and Washington have chaotically attempted to navigate the new paradigm of how politics and tech will interact. The launch of programs like 18F and United States Digital Service (USDS), along with a progressive policy agenda generally embraced in San Francisco and other tech hubs, enabled significant collaboration between the Obama Administration and tech. Will there be opportunities for collaboration between the Trump Administration and tech in 2017 or should we merely prepare for more nasty collisions? If the latter, will the resistance lead to a reversal of progress achieved by 18F, USDS and other modernization efforts that have done so much work to bring the federal government into the 21st century? Can the groundswell of recent grassroots civic engagement among tech professionals be sustainably channeled into effecting positive change for Americans across the country, even in so called Trump states, or will this moment prove to be another instance of over-hyped, fleeting rhetoric?

It\u2019s fairly straight forward, all you have to do is answer why you want to attend?! Isn\u2019t that absolutely insane?! So I got really interested and I wanted to share. This is what they say on the form:\n&gt;Our goal for 2017 is to award as many scholarships as possible, to as many people as we can.

        "text": "The Institute Presents: NEUROSOCIETY \"art that exercises the brain\"- Vogue \"instead of just reading about the latest mind-bending experiments in neuroscience... participate in them.\" -NY Times The Institute Presents: NEUROSOCIETY, co-created by David Byrne and Mala Gaonkar, is an 60-minute immersive theater performance where you will be guided through a series of experiences created in collaboration with working neuroscience labs.\u00a0 For more: The Institute Presents: Neurosociety is a series of interactive environments created by Byrne and Gaonkar that present the emerging work of fifteen cognitive neuroscience labs around the world. You will be led through 4 rooms, and in each room you will experience a surprising aspect of yourself and how you relate to the world and to other people. You will see your hand grow giant and you will be embodied in a doll's body. You will see moving objects freeze, predict real elections and face moral dilemmas Visitors will experience the labs' work in visceral and entertaining ways.\u00a0 With the consent of participants, visitors\u2019 reactions and decisions will be anonymized and used by the labs to further their research. Each visitor thereby becomes a unique and integral part of The Institute\u2019s ongoing research. \u201cExperiments, we feel, are a form of theater.\u201d About David Byrne: David Byrne is co-founder of the influential and acclaimed band Talking Heads. As a solo artist, his career has been prolific and wide-ranging. He has written and directed feature films, exhibited visual art for decades and published both fiction and nonfiction writing to great acclaim. About Mala Gaonkar: A technology investor at an investment advisory firm, Mala Gaonkar's non-profit work focuses on innovations that shift community behaviors and biases, aiding public health and education outcomes. She is a founding trustee of Ariadne Labs, the Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering and Surgo Foundation, and a trustee of Tate.\u00a0 Additional Information: Please check in at reception 15 minutes before your entrance time.\u00a0 Late Entry\u00a0 We humbly ask visitors to be on time\u2014latecomers will not be admitted until after the first room is completed (about 25 minutes in). When possible, latecomers may join join the next group. No refunds for lateness, sorry.\u00a0 Hands Free We request that all visitors check bags, phones and coats. There is no intermission and no photography during the show. Age Restrictions Due to the sensitive themes discussed, Neurosociety is not suitable for children under the age of 13. We strongly discourage bringing infants to this exhibit.\u00a0 School Groups School groups should contact <mailto:rsvp.neurosociety@pacegallery.com|rsvp.neurosociety@pacegallery.com> at least one week before attending Neurosociety so that we can adequately plan for their visit. Please consult the above age restrictions before purchasing tickets for your group.\u00a0 Health and Safety Warning One room in Neurosociety features complete darkness and some single very bright flashes of light (they are NOT strobes); anyone subject to claustrophobia or concerned about this please be advised.\u00a0 Neurosociety is an ADA-accessible performance exhibition that\u00a0will\u00a0require you to move about. One room requires you to stand for 25 minutes, another to sit in a classroom desk and another to sit in a low, reclining chair. We welcome audience members who are mobility-impaired and ask that you arrive early to speak with the Receptionist desk about any questions or concerns you may have. Each show will run for an estimated 60 minutes.\u00a0 The Institute Presents: NEUROSOCIETY has its own parking lot at 350 El Camino Real, Menlo Park.\u00a0 Tickets are non-refundable and are $20.

        "text": "Come join other women who code for a crash course on collaborating in open source communities to make a difference. You will come away with an overview of everything you need to know to make your first contribution to an open source project! Why open source? Traditionally if you had an idea for how to improve documentation, a cool new feature, or a bug fix, you were limited to just reporting these to maintainers of closed source software and waiting for them to get around to it. With open source software, you can take the next step into your own hands: dive into the code, make the changes yourself, and propose them back to the community to improve the project for everyone. Open source projects like npm, Blender, Atom text editor, ROS, OpenCV, Tensorflow, Docker, React Native have each accepted contributions from hundreds if not thousands of contributors just like you. Looking for a job? Rather than tell prospective employers about how you can digest existing codebases and learn new things quickly, show them! There are no requirements for you to have a degree in X, or Y years of experience, with open source contributions. Organizations participating in programs like Outreachy and Google Summer of Code are even offering internships where you get paid to contribute to their open source projects! Who\u2019s this presentation for Women that want to contribute code or documentation to open source projects. This has purposefully been timed to coincide with the Outreachy application deadline on March 30, which requires an initial contribution to one of the participating projects. What you\u2019ll learn The theory: common open source collaboration practices including issue trackers, pull requests, and continuous integration. The practice: Git and github usage, including commits, branching, merging and rebasing. (Not all tools use git or github, but the information is transferrable to other projects). But more than that, you\u2019ll meet a group of women that you can continue working with to contribute to projects together. What you DON\u2019T need to know How anything just mentioned works. It\u2019s OK if you\u2019ve never used git or the command line. You don\u2019t even have to have heard of open source software before! There is no requirement for you to know or use any particular programming language: the presentation will be language-agnostic. What to bring This will be an interactive presentation during which we, as a small group, will all contribute to an example open source project to get hands-on practice. You are welcome to bring a laptop to follow along. In that case, you will have to make sure that: (1) your laptop already has git installed (<https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git>) and (2) you already have a <http://www.github.com|www.github.com> account. About the presenter Deanna is a Software Engineer at the Open Source Robotics Foundation. Just about all of her \"git fu\" and open source experience has been \u201cpassed down\u201d from colleagues, and she wants to share that with others that are looking to join the open source community. This event is open to any and all people who identify as women.",

This also means student who only have access to an iPad not a Mac can also participate\n- This year for the first time all winners will receive accommodations as well as ticket, which will significantly reduce financial stress of attending the conference. In addition they can still apply for travel assistance as we did last year to help with the travel expense. \n\nIf you have questions, or would like to discuss issues with their peers or Apple engineers, please direct them to the Scholarship forum for Scholarships. \n<https://developer.apple.com/go/?id=wwdc-scholarship-forum>"

What: 48-Hour hackathon for iOS, bots, and the Web. This\u00a0collaborative event, featuring superstar hackers and designers to help everyone learn to code, build custom hardware, and generally make ideas come to life. Watch the video. When: February 24-26 (Friday evening through Sunday). See our schedule and details. Where: Startup LaunchPad, San Francisco, CA\u2014a brand-new space from Google, open all weekend until 10pm each day. Why:\u00a0There is a huge opportunity to bring diversity to the technology industry.\u00a0Women and girls, men and boys, we all deserve more opportunities to start coding using simple, powerful tools. Watch our Women of iOSDevCamp video. How:\u00a0Our partner\u00a0PullString makes creating computer conversation super fun and easy! Using any Mac or PC, a writer can script and publish a chat bot using their service, starting for free.\u00a0 If you'd rather learn on any recent-model iPad, Apple's free Swift Playgrounds app will teach you to code joyfully. Learn more about our upcoming event. This event has catalyzed the launch of award winning startups (like Getaround and Foodspotting), the formation of founder dream teams (Square), and the building of a talented and collaborative community of developers.\u00a0 Out-of-town guests are welcome to join our inclusive event. Though projects will include both solo and team efforts, we encourage attendees to build teams of diverse expertise \u2014 business ideas, marketing, design, testing, coding, and back-end development. All attendees should be prepared to participate in the development of a project during the event. Scholarships are available to encourage diversity, and mentors are available. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the most pure and original hackathons. \u00a0People come from all around and really just hack on something, meet new people, cherish the relationships that they create here\u2014and go out to create huge companies. The developers we\u2019ve met at Developer Camp are among the best in the world. Some of them have gone on to join our team. We\u2019re excited to be supporting the event again this year...

        "text": "Learn Arduino using TV-B-Gone as an example project You've probably heard lots about Arduino. But if you don't know what it is, or how you can use it to do all sorts of cool things, then this fun and easy workshop is for you. As an example project, we'll be creating a TV-B-Gone remote control out of an Arduino you can take home with you.\u00a0 If you can do this project, you can do anything! \u00a0 Description: Arduino is an amazingly powerful tool that is very simple to learn to use. It was designed so that artists and non-geeks can start from nothing, and make something cool happen in less than 90 minutes. Yet, it is powerful enough so that uber-geeks can use it for their projects as well. This workshop is easy enough for total newbies to learn all you need to know to get going on an Arduino.\u00a0 No prior knowledge is needed. Taught by Mitch Altman. Participants will make their own Arduino clone, and set it up on solderless breadboards to make their own TV-B-Gone remote control to turn off TVs in public places -- a fun way to learn Arduino (and electronics) basics. Bring your laptop, if you can. For more info (and workshop downloads), check out the Arduino For Total Newbies workshop webpage Big thanks to Ken Shirriff, who came up with the original TV-B-Gone for Arduino. Itinerary: Intro to Arduino Very short lesson to learn everything you need to know about electronics! Then we will learn to solder. Don't let this scare you! I've taught well over 70,000 people to solder, most of whom have never made anything before in their lives. It is actually a very easy skill to learn. It is also very useful. Then we will each make our own Arduino clone from a kit made by Samurai Circuits: U-Do-It-Duino. Now that we each have our own Arduino, we will set up the free and open-source software on our laptops (if you bring one) -- Windows, MacOS, or Linux are all fine! And then its time to make something and learn how easy it is to use Aruino! I'll (very easily!) show you how to read schematic diagrams, and you'll put together your own TV-B-Gone remote control using your U-Do-It-Duino.\u00a0 We will use a solderless breadboard. These are really useful, and provide a fast, and very easy way to put circuits together without needing to solder. Target practice! \u00a0 Summary: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What: Arduino workshop for total newbies, using TV-B-Gone remote controls as an intro \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When: 1:00pm to 4:30pm, Saturday, March 18th \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where: Noisebridge \u00a0\u00a0 map \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Who: Anyone and everyone can have fun learning Arduino. Ages 10 to 100 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Max #: 50 participants\u00a0 --\u00a0 please arrive early!\u00a0 --\u00a0 Presidence given to those who pay in advance. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cost: $35 -- includes everything you need!\u00a0 (Including many parts for experimenting and playing at home.) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And, of course, you get to bring your Arduino TV-B-Gone home with you. Instructor: Mitch Altman Bring your laptop if you want to go home with the free Arduino software installed on it.

        "text": "We talk a lot about the lack of women in technology. What\u2019s keeping them out? The Lady Problem Global Hackathon Series, presented by AngelHack, is launching in a city near you!The Lady Problems Global Hackathon Series is setting out to answer that question. We\u2019re challenging our community of 100,000+ women and men, developers, designers, entrepreneurs to create technology that will address the problems that prevent female entrepreneurship.And course, male allies are welcome too!Why is this an issue?Women represent half of the global population, reinvest 90% of their income into their families and communities, but earn just 10% of the world\u2019s income. Studies have shown that advancing women\u2019s equality can add between $12-28 trillion to global economic growth.According to UN Women, companies with 3 or more women in senior management functions score higher in all dimensions of organizational effectiveness, yet just 4% of Fortune 500 companies are led by women. In startup-land, you\u2019ll find the same results. First Round Capital\u2019s analysis of 300 portfolio companies over ten years showed that startup teams with at least one female founder performed 63% better than all male teams, yet around only 4% of women are backed by VC funding.It\u2019s proven that investing in women creates a better world, and yet they\u2019re not even close to meeting their potential. So what can we do to solve these problems?Hack a solution that will help women access health resources to ensure that they can have successful careers, regardless of whether or not they choose to have children.Hack a solution that ensures that women can be safe when they go to, are at, and come home from work.Hack a solution that helps women gain access to the financial resources, training and support they need to grow their businesses.Hack a solution that helps women succeed and feel confident in the workplace and that they are supported in their careers by their families and communities.Social Good Accelerator: The winning team from each city will be inducted into AngelHack\u2019s first-ever social good accelerator, a 12-week mentorship and acceleration program.Women Who Code: The winning team from each city in an Applaud Her spot in the CODE Review, a featured placement in their global community newsletter.Challenge:Best use of HPE Haven OnDemand in any of the main Lady Problems challenges.Prize:\u00a0The winning team of this challenge will receive the following:Invitation to promote their app/solution and tell the world how they are tackling Lady Problems on the HPE Haven OnDemand blog and LinkedIn group, with promotion via various HPE social media channels.Submitted as candidates for an upcoming press article and could also feature in a video production.All participating teams are also being invited to apply to participate in the HPE Haven Startup Accelerator, with participants benefiting from free/substantially discounted software access to help teams take their solutions to market with fewer technology barriers.One Month is giving away a free 30-day trial to all attendees:Go to:\u00a0<https://onemonth.com/?free_trial_code=LadyProblemsSelect> \"Enroll Now\"Select membership levelAt checkout, receive a 30-day free trialEnjoy!Getty Images API:\u00a0Getty Images encourages the use of diverse imagery in your products! Check out their LeanIn collection here to learn more \u00a0about how you can share powerful depictions of women, girls and the people who support them! Leverage their API to pull images for your products here \u00a0and select the \u201cGetty Test\u201d key option.Day 109:00 AM : Doors Open to Attendees / Breakfast of Champions10:30 AM : Opening Ceremony and Sponsor Talks11:30 AM : Team-building and networking session 12:00 PM : Coding Begins01:00 PM : Lunch02:00 PM : Cisco Breakout Session06:30 PM : Dinner07:00 PM : CODE: Debugging the Gender Gap documentary screening, sponsored by Capital OneVenue will be open if you choose to hack overnight.Day 208:00 AM : Breakfast12:00 PM : Lunch01:00 PM : Hackathon Ends / Submissions due on hackathon.io.02:00 PM : Demos Begin / Demos only / No Slide Decks(If your demo doesn\u2019t work, take us through the code of what you did and where you got stuck. It\u2019s about showing what you\u2019ve learned and not about pitching an idea)04:00 PM: Winners are Announced / Prize-a-thon!Schedule subject to awesome changes. Stay Tuned!Not-So-Fresh Code:You are welcome to start working on your hack before the event. You can present pre-existing projects, but they must be relevant to the hackathon challenges. You also must demo live at the hackathon on Sunday in-person, or via Google Hangout.We highly encourage all participants to attend the hackathon in-person, to meet other like-minded hackers and gain valuable insights from our sponsors about building amazing products!Ownership and IP:Teams have full ownership of everything they build at our events and are free to do with it as they wish.Team Size:Teams of up to 5 humans are allowed. You can also add 1 Cyborg, Furby, drone, or Sphero.Submission:Each hackathon has its individual <http://hackathon.io|hackathon.io> page, which projects should be submitted on. Submissions take place after 24 hours of pure hacking.Demo Your Hack:You must demo your hack in order to present. No slide-decks or Powerpoint will be allowed. Two minute presentation and one minute Q&amp;A from Judges, live during the event in-person or via a Google Hangout.Code of Conduct:You must abide by the Code of Conduct. We have a zero-tolerance policy for harassment. If you\u2019re making others feel unsafe in anyway, we\u2019ll kick you out. End of story.Let\u2019s be honest, y\u2019all can do better than Powerpoints. Which is why we rock with live DEMOS only! No exceptions. To win an AngelHack hackathon, you will have to demo your product for at least 30 seconds, but no more than 2 minutes. Don\u2019t worry if your project is still not 100% perfected. Projects will be judged based on the following criteria:Impact: How impactful will this solution be for its target audience? Is it scalable?Creativity: How original is this solution?Design: How well designed is this solution, from front end through to UI/UX?Execution: How well executed is this solution from start to finish?Related to Challenge: Is the solution relevant to the themes of lady problems around supporting female entrepreneurs through health, education, safety and culture?\u00a0 \u00a0Minnie Ingersoll\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Neha Sampat\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Renata George\u00a0 \u00a0 COO at Shift \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 CEO, <http://Built.io|Built.io> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Managing Director,\u00a0 \u00a0Technologies, Inc. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Zenmen Venture Fund\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rekha Pai\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Annika Peterson\u00a0 \u00a0 Member Board of \u00a0 \u00a0Software Engineer,\u00a0 \u00a0Directors at Fast \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cisco Meraki\u00a0Forward, New Business Incubation at Juniper \u00a0 \u00a0 Networks\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mansi ParikhCEO,KindWhale\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cyrus Gil\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Sahil JainAre all genders welcome?

Node-RED (<http://nodered.org|nodered.org>) is an open-source community project built on top of the Node.js runtime. You will learn how easy it is to connect to Internet of Things devices, IBM Watson services such as Personality Insights, AlchemyAPI, Weather Company Data and other IBM Bluemix services, send text messages with Twilio and tweets with Twitter, and see how to write your own node in Node.js. Spend the rest of the evening hacking together an idea, either with existing nodes or by writing your own custom node. All skill levels are welcome to join. A laptop, a willingness to try something new and meet a new friend, is all that is required. Agenda:5:30 - 6:00\u00a0Registration, Pizza and Networking6:00 - 6:30\u00a0Let's learn about Node-RED6:30 - 8:00\u00a0What can you build? Team up with a couple others and either work through a lab and/or expand on the sample given. No idea is too simple or stupid.8:00 - 8:30\u00a0Show and tell: share what you either built, or the idea you would build given more time",

        "text": "Early Access provides entry to the event at 9:30 AM through the Portwalk gates. However, you don't need a ticket starting at 10 AM - the gates will be wide open. No one will be turned away. AT&amp;T park is transformed into a science wonderland for the concluding event of the Bay Area Science Festival, organized by UC San Francisco, \u2013 a FREE science extravaganza on Saturday November 5th, 2016 10AM-4PM. Last year, more than 30,000 people enjoyed a non-stop program chock-full of interactive exhibits, experiments, games, and shows, all meant to entertain and inspire. With more than 150 exhibits, everyone can find something that will unleash their inner scientist.\u00a0 Rain or Shine! 150 EXHIBITS AND ACTIVITIES Experience over 150 hands-on exhibits and activities from leading science and technology organizations from across the Bay Area. Universities, science museums, research labs, after school organizations, and local companies join forces for an unprecedented opportunity to meet scientists and engineers. Topics include health &amp; medicine, engineering, technology, biotechnology, climate science, and so much more. This year, every exhibit will be framed as investigative questions to encourage explorations and curiosity that we hope will continue throughout the school year. CHEVRON STEM ZONE Join us on the field and the fun, interactive activities that provide an inside-look at the science of sports, train like an astronaut, explore robotics, and pick up a science kit. LIFE SCIENCE ALLEY Experience the best of biotech with a dozen of the Bay Area\u2019s leading life science companies. Extract your DNA, explore your genes, and meet the scientists engineering the next cure. ROBOT ZOO AT&amp;T Park will be overrun by robots of all shapes and sizes. Interact with High School robotics teams, startup companies, and cutting edge research robots. Parking/TransportationWe encourage everyone to take BART or public transportation to the event as we expect big crowds. AT&amp;T Park is also accessible by MUNI and CalTrain. For more information on public transportation options to the ballpark, check out AT&amp;T Park\u2019s transit page. Bike Parking will be provided by the SF Bike Coalition. Limited parking will be available in Lot A for $10/vehicle.",

        "text": "If you need an Uber, Amazon Alexa has your back. Unfortunately if what you need is a conversation buddy, the personal assistant&nbsp;isn&rsquo;t quite up to the task.\nIn an effort to bolster Alexa&rsquo;s social intelligence, Amazon is putting $2.5 million into a new university&nbsp;competition to design and build &ldquo;socialbots&rdquo; for the platform. Engineers will use the Alexa Skills Kit&nbsp;to build the artificial socialites.&nbsp;As part of the competition, the Washington Post, owned by Amazon&rsquo;s Jeff Bezos, will also be making its corpus available to participants as a tool to train the bots.\nTo evaluate progress, Amazon will be letting Alexa users test the&nbsp;conversational chops of the bots in the wild. Once it all goes live, users can simply ask Alexa to chat about a specific topic to engage with the socialbots. At the end of a conversation, these same users will submit feedback that will be a key component in determining which teams advance to the final live judging event.\nThe competition is set to last a year and culminate in the November 2017&nbsp;AWS re:invent conference. Amazon is making the&nbsp;Alexa Prize an annual event, so&nbsp;by the time&nbsp;winners are announced, next year&rsquo;s competition will be gearing up.\nThe team that builds the best socialbot for Alexa will receive&nbsp;$500,000. The school attended by the winning team is also eligible for an additional $1 million, but they will only receive the money if the bot can hold a &ldquo;coherent and engaging&rdquo; conversation with humans for 20 minutes.\nAn additional $1 million will be split up in $100,000 increments and given to ten teams as a stipend to finance work. These teams will also be receiving Alexa enabled hardware,&nbsp;AWS services, and support from Alexa engineers.\nRegistration is open now, and interested teams can find competition rules on the Amazon developer website.&nbsp;\nOne of the hardest things &nbsp;to do in a conversation is listen, to truly let go of thinking about yourself and be present for another person. It&rsquo;s also something most personal assistants do pretty well right now. While natural language processing is no joke, teams will be starting with something that even humans can&rsquo;t do very well in conversation.\nIt&rsquo;s also why pop-culture representations of AI personal assistants usually involve a character just looking for someone to listen to them.&nbsp;Hopefully by next season&rsquo;s Mr.Robot, Dom will not only have a loyal listener in her Alexa enabled Echo, but someone who she&nbsp;can have a&nbsp;heart to heart with &nbsp;&mdash; and maybe also gossip with about the morning&rsquo;s&nbsp;Washington Post.",

These groups are proving to be a game-changing consumer segment across markets because of the way they are influencing their communities across race, culture, politics, gender identity and language -- case in point, the term Latinx.Imagine what could happen if we\u00a0gathered 100 entrepreneurially-minded Latinxs and allies over 54 hours to identify and design technology solutions to problems\u00a0disproportionately facing the U.S. Latinx community? What if we\u00a0facilitated mentorship\u00a0by some of the most talented technologists, business innovators, and prominent investors?And, what if this social experiment\u00a0was\u00a0hosted in Oakland, one of the most diverse, activist, and innovative communities in the nation?This is why we are re-launching Startup Weekend Oakland and organizing the first ever Latinx in Tech Edition.

Check out this video from last year\u2019s event!\u00a0FAQHow do I register? There are two ways to register, but either way you\u2019ll end up here.Option 1: When you purchase your QuickBooks Connect 2016 pass, you have the option to participate in the Hackathon at no additional charge -- but you must select the option \u201cattending and hacking\u201d.Option 2: If you aren\u2019t sure about the whole conference thing, and just want to hack over the weekend, you register right here on this\u00a0Eventbrite\u00a0page. Cost is $25 (and worth every penny and then some).Who is qualified to participate?The hack is open to everyone who wants to design, code, and build new and innovative apps that target small businesses or non-profits.Can I bring a team?Yes, you can bring a team (up to 4 people per team) or work solo. Or you can come solo and look to join a team once you\u2019re at the hack.How do I win prizes?Build a brand new solution that addresses one of these challenges:Category 1: Create an app that saves a small business time or money by solving a unique SMB problem.Category 2: Create an app that saves a non-profit time or money by solving a unique non-profit problem.What\u2019s more, API partners at the hack might also offer their own challenges and prizes.What can we win?Each of the two main categories will offer first, second, and third place prizes:First place prize for each category:Each member of the 1st place team (up to 4 team members) will receive a Tech Pack valued at $2,000 USD, consisting of:DJI Phantom 4 QuadcopterLuma Home WiFi System- 3 packBeats Solo2 Wireless On-Ear HeadphonesSecond place prize for each category:Each member of the 2nd place team (up to 4 team members) will receive a GoPro Hero4 camera, valued at $400 USD.Third place prize for each category:Each member of the 3rd place team (up to 4 team members) will receive a Razer BlackWidow Chroma Clicky Mechanical Gaming Keyboard, valued at $100 USD.What kind of code can I write? Fresh code! Code in your favorite language and use the APIs and tools you prefer. In the spirit of a hackathon, respect the start and stop times for hacking -- your solution should be built at the hack during the hack hours. See the official rules for <http://details.Do|details.Do> I need to integrate QuickBooks or Intuit APIs into my hack? \u00a0No, this hack is all about creating new innovations that help small businesses and non-profits. You are welcome to use the QuickBooks APIs -- we\u2019ll have plenty of staff on hand to help and we might even consider you for an extra prize if you do -- but it's not required.How is the hack structured? Doors open on Sat 10/22 at 10am for you to get settled, API demos will start at 11am, small biz and non-profit owners will be on hand to give you feedback on your ideas over lunch, and then hacking starts at 1pm, runs through the night, and ends Sun 10/23 at 1pm. Pitches to judges will start around 1:30pm and continue till we\u2019re done, followed by an awards <http://ceremony.Do|ceremony.Do> you own my hack? \u00a0Nope, that\u2019s yours to keep -- and hopefully finish! See the official rules for details.Should I plan to hack overnight? You\u2019ll have only 24 hours from 1pm Sat to 1pm Sun to design, code, and test your amazing solution, so you might very well want to hack through the night. But if you need a sleep break or nap, no worries.\u00a0Is there a code of conduct for this hack?Sure is! \u00a0Check it out\u00a0here.Where can I find the official rules?The official rules for the Small Business Tech Hackathon are here.",

We use a lot of Auto Layout at LinkedIn, but after we ran into some frustrating performance problems, we decided to build and open source our own solution called LayoutKit (<http://layoutkit.org>). Not only is LayoutKit much faster than Auto Layout, but it is also easier to use because layouts are declarative, immutable, and thread-safe.About\u00a0Nick:\u00a0Nick is a Software Engineer at LinkedIn who is currently working on building mobile infrastructure that scales to all of LinkedIn's apps and developers. He has helped ship three of LinkedIn's apps including the latest iteration of LinkedIn's main application. He enjoys crafting reusable components with clean APIs that are a joy to use.\u00a0Talk #2:\u00a0A Recipe for Value SEMANTICS (not value types!)Who can forget 2015, The Year of the Value Type? Through numerous blogs and videos, the Swift community explored how value types (structs and enums) enable new, simpler, safer patterns for application architecture.This talk will argue for an important proviso: what a lot of these talks are trying to talk about is not value types, but value *semantics*. Value semantics is tricky to define but the reward is a profound satori-like experience of enlightenment, and a better understanding of how to use Swift.This talk will explain value semantics, and provide a straightforward recipe for enforcing value semantics in Swift using value types, reference types, or a mixture of the two.Schedule: \u00a06:30 - 7pm: Refreshments and food.\u00a0Food will include options for omnivores, vegans, and gluten-free folks. We will not be serving alcohol at this meetup, but we'll have plenty of soda options.\u00a07pm: Presentations + Q&amp;A. We'll have a very short break between presentations.\u00a0We welcome you to stay and chat afterwards.\u00a0Recording:\u00a0All our talks are recorded, so if you can't make it to the meetup you can still watch the talks about two weeks afterwards\u00a0here.Location: \u00a0The Realm office is on\u00a0Townsend St. between 2nd and 3rd.\u00a0Look for the door-person standing outside the building. He or she will guide you up.\u00a0Getting there: \u00a0\u2022 \u00a05-minute walk to the King St. Caltrain station. 20-minute walk from the Powell St. BART Station.\u2022 \u00a0The building entrance is next to the parking garage.\u00a0\u2022 \u00a0Bike Parking: You're welcome to bring your bike inside, but you'll need to carry it to the 2nd floor.\u2022 Please note that the building doesn't have an elevator so the venue isn't handicap accessible unfortunately.\u00a0Thanks to:\u00a0Realm for hosting and providing food + drinks.\u00a0Call for speakers!We're looking for speakers! Know anyone? :) We hope so! Please fill out\u00a0this short talk proposal form.\u00a0We have openings for lightning talks (up-to 10 mins) as well as longer talks (20-30 mins) talks.\u00a0Questions?\u00a0Email Fred at\u00a0fp@realm.io\u00a0or Shadi\u00a0at <mailto:sn@realm.io|sn@realm.io>",
