Last week, we formed groups to write a collaborative \"world-building\" fiction. Each group seemed more interested in the future than the past or present so I let go of my original plan, which is fine.\n\nGroups:\nSal/Tony/Dacio\nFode/Betsy/Sukhrob\nKhalil/Shane/Nya/Henry\n\nAs a component of this assignment we looked at images of the \"Hero's Journey\" formula for story writing aka \"narrative arc\" as a way to structure your story (Google it).\n\nEach story will include:\nsetting (place, which can be imaginary or actual, and time: how far into the future?)\ncharacters (protagonists / antagonists) situation (what do the characters want? what are the obstacles? do they get it in the end?)\n\nThere is a research component to the assignment, as even fiction is based in the facts of reality to give the reader a ground to stand on. Each group member should be prepared to cite one reference to support your understanding of how future emerges from history, why characters behave the way they do, conflict resolution techniques, more details on Hero's Journey archetypes, or a reading on the craft of story writing.\n\nThere is no class next week on April 26, as I will be at a required all-day training. Please use free time between now and when we meet again on Friday May 3 to do research and meet with your group to move the story forward.\n\nWe'll have a workshop in class on May 3 to help push the draft to next level. I\u2019ll also ask each person to give a short talk on your research findings.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.\n\nDr. R",

Please plan to attend all Friday classes, on time at 10am and stay till the end at 12:50. Attendance and participation are the biggest part of the grade to pass the course as most of the work will take place during class hours. Here is the syllabus. For Friday 2/1, please do some research on \"technical blogs,\" what they look like and have to say, find three that you like and think are well written. Come to class prepared to analyze and say why, and to begin writing your own. I look forward to meeting everyone on the roster. Enjoy your week.",
