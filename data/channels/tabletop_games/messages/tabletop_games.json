For the experimental session we'll just be doing world building and maybe get to character creation.\n\nIn preparation, you can think about genres in fiction you like and what elements you think are important. We could play in a D&amp;D-like fantasy land, a cyberpunk dystopia, treasure planet universe, a western with cowboys and train chases, or anything you can come up with. For example, the last time I played fate my group decided we really like space operas and had to decide if we wanted aliens in our world, how sophisticated AI is, and what kind of government structure we wanted our galactic society to have.\n\nAlso think about what kind of characters you enjoy playing: what kind of hero do you want to be? what role do you like playing in a party? what kind of trouble do you like to make? In fate you basically have infinite flexibility on what type of character you can play. The only restrictions are the ones we decide on as a group. My party ended up being a genetically constructed superhuman with a brain injury, a broken military AI who cannot harm humans under any circumstance, one accidental clone (out of thousands) of a random college girl from the rich people planet, and a 12 year old street rat computer prodigy.\n\n<https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/character-creation>",

I didn\u2019t know about Open Legend until yesterday, but I can tell you that it fits our campaign and the various skill levels of our group even better than Fantasy AGE. Sorry to confuse everyone with that. Last time it\u2019s changing, I promise. \n\nWe need to schedule a time to go over the rules, character creation, and gameplay mechanics with everyone at some point. If you could fill out the doodle with times/dates that work for you, I can meet with everyone at once, or a couple groups of people if that\u2019s easier. \n\n<http://doodle.com/poll/i7xm8uquqhd77md8>",

    "text": "<!channel> For a more customized experience, there\u2019s also the Open Legend system, just newly released, that uses lots of dice and a cool \u201cexploding dice\u201d mechanic that lets you reroll and add any die that rolls max value. It allows for much more character customization, so there\u2019s a bit more information, but it, like Fantasy AGE, is designed to allow new players to jump in fairly easily. I\u2019m researching it a bit more now to see which might be better for the group, but feel free to check out the website (<http://www.openlegendrpg.com/>) for more inspiration for your characters!",

    "text": "<!channel> Alright you tabletop RPG nerds! Listen up! From what I\u2019ve gathered, we\u2019re pretty much over creating the world and most people are ready to play. This is great! I\u2019m excited that you are excited! \n\nHowever, only a couple of people have approached me and asked about their characters or asked questions about the game! I take this to mean that only a couple people are really seriously interested in playing. This is fine! I don\u2019t expect everyone to play, nor do I think I could successfully guide everyone who expressed interest without some help! I just need to know who wants to play, who wants to spectate, and who wants to just jump in every once in a while to play a recurring character. If you want to play, and can commit to playing frequently (once every 1-2 weeks) then you will be part of the core group. Anyone not part of the core group is welcome to join whenever they are available! And people may come and go from the core group over time. That\u2019s fine! I just need to know who actually wants to play! \n\nTo that end, I\u2019m providing 2 pdfs below that include all of the necessary information for players to learn everything you want to know about the system we\u2019re going to be playing. Do I expect you to read all of it? Of course not, but the more you do read, the better prepared you will be. I\u2019m happy to answer any questions you might have, and many questions will surely be asked in the first few sessions of play. \n\nLuckily, the Fantasy AGE system is incredibly easy (specifically designed to be playable even for people who are completely new to RPGs) to make characters with, so the number one thing I need everyone to do is simply figure out who you want to play! There are several races and classes available in the books! Pick a combination that seems cool to you and makes sense and we will make it work! (Obviously, any mention to \u201ccomputers\u201d or \u201cblasters\u201d or other future tech will be replaced with an equivalent version in our own campaign). \n\nFor those of you who are a little more advanced or who want to take it a step further, if there is a specific race or class that does not exist in these books that you would like to explore, talk to me! If you are willing to put in the effort to make it happen, I am absolutely willing to make that happen for you! I want you to have fun just as much (if not more!) than you do! That\u2019s my entire job as your Game Master, and I couldn\u2019t be more excited!\n\n\nSo get pumped! Be excited! AND LET\u2019S ROLL THOSE DICE!!!!",

(I think I might be missing one of the people who was there at the end, but I\u2019m not sure). We don\u2019t have to make it through everybody if we decide as a group that it is enough, but I want to at least make sure that everyone has their say, gets to create their own Legend/Icon, and is engaged with the story. \n\nGiven how many people have decided to join, we will probably have to run two groups, unless the \u201ccore group\u201d (the group that shows up every time/nearly every time) is small enough. We\u2019ll deal with that when the time comes. \n\nIf you have a cool idea for a character, great! Send me your ideas! I can help you build something fun and engaging! Or, if you don\u2019t have an idea for a character, or you want to let Fate decide what kind of character you want to play, you can do that as well. Fate characters will have the potential to be stronger than built characters, but can also be weaker. They are a gamble! PM me if you are interested!",
